# Logging

Dioxus has a wide range of supported platforms, each with their own logging requirements. We'll discuss the different options available to you.

#### The Log Crate

The [Log](https://crates.io/crates/log) crate is the most universally recognized logging facade in Rust. It is also the easiest to work with in Dioxus; therefore we will be focusing on loggers that work with this crate.

The log crate provides a variety of simple `println`-like macros with varying levels of severity.
The available macros are as follows with the highest severity on the bottom:

````rs
fn main() {
    log::trace!("trace");
    log::debug!("debug");
    log::info!("info");
    log::warn!("warn");
    log::error!("error");
}
````

All the loggers provided on this page are, besides configuration and initialization, interfaced using these macros. Often you will also utilize the log crate's `LevelFilter` enum. This enum usually represents the lowest log severity you want your application to emit and can be loaded from a configuration file, environment variable, or other.

For more information, visit log crate's [docs](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/).

## Dioxus Logger

[Dioxus Logger](https://crates.io/crates/dioxus-logger) is a planned-to-be feature-rich logger that supports all of Dioxus' platforms. Currently only Desktop, Web, and any server-based targets work with Dioxus Logger.

The easiest way to use Dioxus Logger is by calling the `init()` function:

````rs
use log::LevelFilter;

fn main() {
    // Init logger
    dioxus_logger::init(LevelFilter::Info).expect("failed to init logger");
    // Dioxus code
}
````

The `dioxus_logger::init()` function initializes Dioxus Logger with the log crate using the default configuration and provided `LevelFilter`.

#### Custom Format

Dioxus Logger allows you more control with the ability to set a custom format using the `new` function on the `DioxusLogger` struct:

````rs
use log::LevelFilter;

fn main() {
    // Init logger
    dioxus_logger::DioxusLogger::new(LevelFilter::Info)
        .use_format("[{LEVEL}] {PATH} - {ARGS}")
        .build()
        .expect("failed to init logger");

    // Dioxus code
}
````

In this example, we are building a new `DioxusLogger` struct, providing the `LevelFilter`, calling the `use_format()` function, and initializing the logger with the `build()` function (acts as `init()` in the previous example).

The key function call in this example is `use_format()`. This function takes a `&str` that specifies how you want your logs to be formatted. To specify a variable in the format, you wrap it's name in `{}`.

The available variables are:

* LEVEL     - The `LevelFilter` of the emitted log.
* PATH      - The file path of where the log was emitted, or the crate name.
* ARGS      - The arguments passed through the log macro.
* TIMESTAMP - A timestamp of when the log was emitted. (Requires `timestamps` feature)

#### Timestamps

Another feature of Dioxus Logger is the ability to include timestamps with your logs. By default, this feature is disabled and has to be enabled by adding `timestamps` to your features section of the `dioxus-logger` dependency:

````toml
dioxus-logger = { version = "*", features = ["timestamps"] }
````

By enabling this feature, you gain access to the `TIMESTAMP` format variable.

#### Dioxus Logger Platform Intricacies

On web, Dioxus Logger will use [web-sys](https://crates.io/crates/web-sys) to interact with `console.log()` to output your logs to the browser's console. On Desktop and server-based targets, Dioxus Logger will output using `println()`.

#### Final Notes

Dioxus Logger is the preferred logger to use with Dioxus if it suites your needs. There are many more features to come and Dioxus Logger is planned to become an integral part of Dioxus. If there are any feature suggestions or issues with Dioxus Logger, feel free to reach out on the [Dioxus Discord Server](https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM)!

For more information, visit Dioxus Logger's [docs](https://docs.rs/dioxus-logger/latest/dioxus_logger/).

## Desktop and Server

For Dioxus' desktop and server targets, you can generally use the logger of your choice.

Some popular options are:

* [env_logger](https://crates.io/crates/env_logger)
* [simple_logger](https://crates.io/crates/simple_logger)
* [pretty_env_logger](https://crates.io/crates/pretty_env_logger)

To keep this guide short, we will not be covering the usage of these loggers.

## Web

[WASM Logger](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-logger) is a logging interface that can be used with Dioxus' web platform.

The easiest way to use WASM Logger is with the `init` function:

````rs
fn main() {
    // Init logger
    wasm_logger::init(wasm_logger::Config::default());

    // Dioxus code
}
````

This starts WASM Logger with a `LevelFilter` of `Debug`.

To specify a custom `LevelFilter`, build the `Config` struct:

````rs
use log::LevelFilter;

fn main() {
    // Init logger
    let log_config = wasm_logger::Config::new(LevelFilter::Info);
    wasm_logger::init(log_config);

    // Dioxus code
}
````

#### Wasm Logger Platform Intricacies

WASM Logger also uses the [web-sys](https://crates.io/crates/web-sys) crate to output to the console.

For more information, visit wasm-logger's [docs](https://docs.rs/wasm-logger/latest/wasm_logger/).

## Android

[Android Logger](https://crates.io/crates/android_logger) is a logging interface that can be used when targeting Android. Android Logger runs whenever an event `native_activity_create` is called by the Android system:

````rs
use log::LevelFilter;
use android_logger::Config;

fn native_activity_create() {
    android_logger::init_once(
        Config::default()
            .with_max_level(LevelFilter::Info)
            .with_tag("myapp");
    );
}
````

The `with_tag()` is what your app's logs will show as.

#### Viewing Android Logs

Android logs are sent to logcat. To use logcat through the Android debugger, run:

````cmd
adb -d logcat
````

Your Android device will need developer options/usb debugging enabled.

For more information, visit android_logger's [docs](https://docs.rs/android_logger/latest/android_logger/).

## iOS

The current option for iOS is the [oslog](https://crates.io/crates/oslog) crate.

````rs
fn main() {
    // Init logger
    OsLogger::new("com.example.test")
        .level_filter(LevelFilter::Debug)
        .init()
        .expect("failed to init logger");
    // Dioxus code
}
````

#### Viewing IOS Logs

You can view the emitted logs in Xcode.

For more information, visit [oslog](https://crates.io/crates/oslog).
# Internationalization

If your application supports multiple languages, the [Dioxus SDK](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/sdk) crate contains helpers to make working with translations in your application easier.

## The full code for internationalization

````rs@i18n.rs
use dioxus::prelude::*;
use dioxus_std::i18n::*;
use dioxus_std::translate;
use std::str::FromStr;

fn main() {
    dioxus_web::launch(app);
}

static EN_US: &str = r#"{
    "id": "en-US",
    "texts": {
        "messages": {
            "hello_world": "Hello World!"
        },
        "messages.hello": "Hello {name}"
    }
}"#;
static ES_ES: &str = r#"{
    "id": "es-ES",
    "texts": {
        "messages": {
            "hello_world": "Hola Mundo!"
        },
        "messages.hello": "Hola {name}"
    }
}"#;

#[allow(non_snake_case)]
fn Body(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let i18 = use_i18(cx);

    let change_to_english = move |_| i18.set_language("en-US".parse().unwrap());
    let change_to_spanish = move |_| i18.set_language("es-ES".parse().unwrap());

    render!(
        button {
            onclick: change_to_english,
            label {
                "English"
            }
        }
        button {

            label {
                "Spanish"
            }
        }
        p { translate!(i18, "messages.hello_world") }
        p { translate!(i18, "messages.hello", name: "Dioxus")  }
    )
}

fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    use_init_i18n(
        cx,
        "en-US".parse().unwrap(),
        "en-US".parse().unwrap(),
        || {
            let en_us = Language::from_str(EN_US).unwrap();
            let es_es = Language::from_str(ES_ES).unwrap();
            vec![en_us, es_es]
        },
    );

    render!(Body {})
}
