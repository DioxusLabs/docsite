# Dioxus Hot-Reloading Reference

The Dioxus Hot-Reload is very powerful. When used properly, it is by-far the fastest tool to build apps with Rust.

Dioxus 0.5 featured a slightly limited form of hot-reloading while Dioxus 0.6 drastically improved it.

 > 
 > Currently Dioxus cannot hot-reload *Rust* code, only RSX markup. Usually, modifying Rust code requires a full rebuild.

We provide this text guide as a resource for the details of hot-reloading. This guide also has an accompanying video as well:
