# Component Lifecycle

## Initializing State with `use_hook`

`use_hook` lets you create new state for your component. The closure you pass to `use_hook` will be called once the first time the component is rendered. Every time the component is re-rendered, the value that was created the first run will be re-used.

```rust, no_run
{{#include src/doc_examples/component_lifecycle.rs:use_hook}}
```
```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
    component_lifecycle::UseHookDemo {}
}
```

## Rerendering

You can use [tracked values](../state/index.md) to re-render your component whenever a value changes. 

```rust, no_run
{{#include src/doc_examples/component_lifecycle.rs:rerenders}}
```
```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
    component_lifecycle::RerenderDemo {}
}
```

### ⚠️ Don't mutate state in the body of a component

You should avoid changing state in the body of a component. If you read and write to state in the body of a component, you can cause an infinite loop as the component tries to rerender because of the change which triggers another state change.

```rust, no_run
{{#include src/doc_examples/component_lifecycle.rs:dont_mutate}}
```

Instead, derive state with `use_memo`, `use_resource`, or mutate state in a effect.

## Using Effects

You can use effects to run code whenever a component is rendered.


```rust, no_run
{{#include src/doc_examples/component_lifecycle.rs:effect}}
```
```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
    component_lifecycle::EffectDemo {}
}
```

## Cleaning Up Components with Drop

Before a component is dropped, it will drop all of its hooks. You can use this drop behavior to clean up any resources that your component is using. If you just need the drop effect, you can use the [`use_drop`](https://docs.rs/dioxus/latest/dioxus/prelude/fn.use_drop.html) hook.

```rust, no_run
{{#include src/doc_examples/component_lifecycle.rs:drop}}
```
```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
    component_lifecycle::DropDemo {}
}
```
