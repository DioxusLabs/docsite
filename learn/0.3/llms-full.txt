# Getting Started

This section will help you set up your Dioxus project!

## Prerequisites

### An Editor

Dioxus integrates very well with the [Rust-Analyzer LSP plugin](https://rust-analyzer.github.io) which will provide appropriate syntax highlighting, code navigation, folding, and more.

### Rust

Head over to [https://rust-lang.org](http://rust-lang.org) and install the Rust compiler.

We strongly recommend going through the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html) *completely*. However, we hope that a Dioxus app can serve as a great first Rust project. With Dioxus, you'll learn about:

* Error handling
* Structs, Functions, Enums
* Closures
* Macros

We've put a lot of care into making Dioxus syntax familiar and easy to understand, so you won't need deep knowledge of async, lifetimes, or smart pointers until you start building complex Dioxus apps.

## Setup Guides

Dioxus supports multiple platforms. Choose the platform you want to target below to get platform-specific setup instructions:

* [Web](web.md): runs in the browser through WebAssembly
* [Server Side Rendering](ssr.md): renders to HTML text on the server
* [Liveview](liveview.md): runs on the server, renders in the browser using WebSockets
* [Desktop](desktop.md): runs in a web view on desktop
* [Mobile](mobile.md): runs in a web view on mobile
* [Terminal UI](tui.md): renders text-based graphics in the terminal
# Desktop Overview

Build a standalone native desktop app that looks and feels the same across operating systems.

Apps built with Dioxus are typically \<5mb in size and use existing system resources, so they won't hog extreme amounts of RAM or memory.

Examples:

* [File Explorer](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/blob/master/file-explorer)
* [WiFi Scanner](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/blob/master/wifi-scanner)

[![File ExplorerExample](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/raw/master/file-explorer/assets/image.png)](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/tree/master/file-explorer)

## Support

The desktop is a powerful target for Dioxus but is currently limited in capability when compared to the Web platform. Currently, desktop apps are rendered with the platform's WebView library, but your Rust code is running natively on a native thread. This means that browser APIs are *not* available, so rendering WebGL, Canvas, etc is not as easy as the Web. However, native system APIs *are* accessible, so streaming, WebSockets, filesystem, etc are all viable APIs. In the future, we plan to move to a custom web renderer-based DOM renderer with WGPU integrations.

Dioxus Desktop is built off [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). Right now there aren't any Dioxus abstractions over keyboard shortcuts, menubar, handling, etc, so you'll want to leverage Tauri – mostly [Wry](http://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/) and [Tao](http://github.com/tauri-apps/tao)) directly.

# Getting started

## Platform-Specific Dependencies

Dioxus desktop renders through a web view. Depending on your platform, you might need to install some dependancies.

### Windows

Windows Desktop apps depend on WebView2 – a library that should be installed in all modern Windows distributions. If you have Edge installed, then Dioxus will work fine. If you *don't* have Webview2, [then you can install it through Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/). MS provides 3 options:

1. A tiny "evergreen" *bootstrapper* that fetches an installer from Microsoft's CDN
1. A tiny *installer* that fetches Webview2 from Microsoft's CDN
1. A statically linked version of Webview2 in your final binary for offline users

For development purposes, use Option 1.

### Linux

Webview Linux apps require WebkitGtk. When distributing, this can be part of your dependency tree in your `.rpm` or `.deb`. However, likely, your users will already have WebkitGtk.

````bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libappindicator3-dev
````

When using Debian/bullseye `libappindicator3-dev` is no longer available but replaced by `libayatana-appindicator3-dev`.

````bash
# on Debian/bullseye use:
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev
````

If you run into issues, make sure you have all the basics installed, as outlined in the [Tauri docs](https://tauri.studio/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#setting-up-linux).

### MacOS

Currently – everything for macOS is built right in! However, you might run into an issue if you're using nightly Rust due to some permissions issues in our Tao dependency (which have been resolved but not published).

## Creating a Project

Create a new crate:

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd demo
````

Add Dioxus and the desktop renderer as dependencies (this will edit your `Cargo.toml`):

````shell
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-desktop
````

Edit your `main.rs`:

````rs@hello_world_desktop.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
// import the prelude to get access to the `rsx!` macro and the `Scope` and `Element` types
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // launch the dioxus app in a webview
    dioxus_desktop::launch(App);
}

// define a component that renders a div with the text "Hello, world!"
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}
````
# Web

Build single-page applications that run in the browser with Dioxus. To run on the Web, your app must be compiled to WebAssembly and depend on the `dioxus` and `dioxus-web` crates.

A build of Dioxus for the web will be roughly equivalent to the size of a React build (70kb vs 65kb) but it will load significantly faster because [WebAssembly can be compiled as it is streamed](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/).

Examples:

* [TodoMVC](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/tree/master/todomvc)
* [ECommerce](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/tree/master/ecommerce-site)

[![TodoMVC example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/raw/master/todomvc/example.png)](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/blob/master/todomvc)

 > 
 > Note: Because of the limitations of Wasm, [not every crate will work](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/reference/which-crates-work-with-wasm.html) with your web apps, so you'll need to make sure that your crates work without native system calls (timers, IO, etc).

## Support

The Web is the best-supported target platform for Dioxus.

* Because your app will be compiled to WASM you have access to browser APIs through [wasm-bingen](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/introduction.html).
* Dioxus provides hydration to resume apps that are rendered on the server. See the [hydration example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/master/packages/web/examples/hydrate.rs) for more details.

## Tooling

To develop your Dioxus app for the web, you'll need a tool to build and serve your assets. We recommend using [dioxus-cli](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/cli) which includes a build system, Wasm optimization, a dev server, and support hot reloading:

````shell
cargo install dioxus-cli
````

Make sure the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target for rust is installed:

````shell
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
````

## Creating a Project

Create a new crate:

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd demo
````

Add Dioxus and the web renderer as dependencies (this will edit your `Cargo.toml`):

````bash
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-web
````

Edit your `main.rs`:

````rs@hello_world_web.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
// import the prelude to get access to the `rsx!` macro and the `Scope` and `Element` types
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // launch the web app
    dioxus_web::launch(App);
}

// create a component that renders a div with the text "Hello, world!"
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}

````

And to serve our app:

````bash
dioxus serve
````
# Setting Up Hot Reload

1. Hot reloading allows much faster iteration times inside of rsx calls by interpreting them and streaming the edits.
1. It is useful when changing the styling/layout of a program, but will not help with changing the logic of a program.
1. Currently the cli only implements hot reloading for the web renderer.

# Setup

Install [dioxus-cli](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/cli).
Hot reloading is automatically enabled when using the web renderer on debug builds.

# Usage

1. run:

````
dioxus serve --hot-reload
````

2. change some code within a rsx macro
2. open your localhost in a browser
2. save and watch the style change without recompiling

# Limitations

1. The interpreter can only use expressions that existed on the last full recompile. If you introduce a new variable or expression to the rsx call, it will trigger a full recompile to capture the expression.
1. Components and Iterators can contain arbitrary rust code and will trigger a full recompile when changed.
# Server-Side Rendering

The Dioxus VirtualDom can be rendered server-side.

[Example: Dioxus DocSite](https://github.com/dioxusLabs/docsite)

## Multithreaded Support

The Dioxus VirtualDom, sadly, is not currently `Send`. Internally, we use quite a bit of interior mutability which is not thread-safe. This means you can't easily use Dioxus with most web frameworks like Tide, Rocket, Axum, etc.

To solve this, you'll want to spawn a VirtualDom on its own thread and communicate with it via channels.

When working with web frameworks that require `Send`, it is possible to render a VirtualDom immediately to a String – but you cannot hold the VirtualDom across an await point. For retained-state SSR (essentially LiveView), you'll need to create a pool of VirtualDoms.

## Setup

For this guide, we're going to show how to use Dioxus SSR with [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/).

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed, and then create a new project:

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd app
````

Add Dioxus and the ssr renderer as dependencies:

````shell
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-ssr
````

Next, add all the Axum dependencies. This will be different if you're using a different Web Framework

````
cargo add tokio --features full
cargo add axum
````

Your dependencies should look roughly like this:

````toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.4.5"
dioxus = { version = "*" }
dioxus-ssr = { version = "*" }
tokio = { version = "1.15.0", features = ["full"] }
````

Now, set up your Axum app to respond on an endpoint.

````rust
use axum::{response::Html, routing::get, Router};
use dioxus::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let addr = std::net::SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    println!("listening on http://{}", addr);

    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(
            Router::new()
                .route("/", get(app_endpoint))
                .into_make_service(),
        )
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
````

And then add our endpoint. We can either render `rsx!` directly:

````rust
async fn app_endpoint() -> Html<String> {
    // render the rsx! macro to HTML
    Html(dioxus_ssr::render_lazy(rsx! {
        div { "hello world!" }
    }))
}
````

Or we can render VirtualDoms.

````rust
async fn app_endpoint() -> Html<String> {
    // create a component that renders a div with the text "hello world"
    fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
        cx.render(rsx!(div { "hello world" }))
    }
    // create a VirtualDom with the app component
    let mut app = VirtualDom::new(app);
    // rebuild the VirtualDom before rendering
    let _ = app.rebuild();

    // render the VirtualDom to HTML
    Html(dioxus_ssr::render_vdom(&app))
}
````

And that's it!

 > 
 > You might notice that you cannot hold the VirtualDom across an await point. Dioxus is currently not ThreadSafe, so it *must* remain on the thread it started. We are working on loosening this requirement.
# Liveview

Liveview allows apps to *run* on the server and *render* in the browser. It uses WebSockets to communicate between the server and the browser.

Examples:

* [`Axum Example`](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/liveview/examples/axum.rs)
* [`Salvo Example`](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/liveview/examples/salvo.rs)
* [`Warp Example`](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/liveview/examples/warp.rs)

## Support

Liveview is currently limited in capability when compared to the Web platform. Liveview apps run on the server in a native thread. This means that browser APIs are not available, so rendering WebGL, Canvas, etc is not as easy as the Web. However, native system APIs are accessible, so streaming, WebSockets, filesystem, etc are all viable APIs.

## Setup

For this guide, we're going to show how to use Dioxus Liveview with [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/).

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed, and then create a new project:

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd app
````

Add Dioxus and the liveview renderer with the Axum feature as dependencies:

````shell
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-liveview --features axum
````

Next, add all the Axum dependencies. This will be different if you're using a different Web Framework

````
cargo add tokio --features full
cargo add axum
````

Your dependencies should look roughly like this:

````toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.4.5"
dioxus = { version = "*" }
dioxus-liveview = { version = "*", features = ["axum"] }
tokio = { version = "1.15.0", features = ["full"] }
````

Now, set up your Axum app to respond on an endpoint.

````rs@hello_world_liveview.rs
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let addr: std::net::SocketAddr = ([127, 0, 0, 1], 3030).into();

    let view = dioxus_liveview::LiveViewPool::new();

    let app = Router::new()
        // The root route contains the glue code to connect to the WebSocket
        .route(
            "/",
            get(move || async move {
                Html(format!(
                    r#"
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                <head> <title>Dioxus LiveView with Axum</title>  </head>
                <body> <div id="main"></div> </body>
                {glue}
                </html>
                "#,
                    // Create the glue code to connect to the WebSocket on the "/ws" route
                    glue = dioxus_liveview::interpreter_glue(&format!("ws://{addr}/ws"))
                ))
            }),
        )
        // The WebSocket route is what Dioxus uses to communicate with the browser
        .route(
            "/ws",
            get(move |ws: WebSocketUpgrade| async move {
                ws.on_upgrade(move |socket| async move {
                    // When the WebSocket is upgraded, launch the LiveView with the app component
                    _ = view.launch(dioxus_liveview::axum_socket(socket), app).await;
                })
            }),
        );

    println!("Listening on http://{}", addr);

    axum::Server::bind(&addr.to_string().parse().unwrap())
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
````

And then add our app component:

````rs@hello_world_liveview.rs
fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}
````

And that's it!
# Terminal UI

You can build a text-based interface that will run in the terminal using Dioxus.

![Hello World screenshot](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/rink/raw/master/examples/example.png)

 > 
 > Note: this book was written with HTML-based platforms in mind. You might be able to follow along with TUI, but you'll have to adapt a bit.

## Support

TUI support is currently quite experimental. But, if you're willing to venture into the realm of the unknown, this guide will get you started.

* It uses flexbox for the layout
* It only supports a subset of the attributes and elements
* Regular widgets will not work in the tui render, but the tui renderer has its own widget components that start with a capital letter. See the [widgets example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/master/packages/tui/examples/tui_widgets.rs)
* 1px is one character line height. Your regular CSS px does not translate
* If your app panics, your terminal is wrecked. This will be fixed eventually

## Getting Set up

Start by making a new package and adding Dioxus and the TUI renderer as dependancies.

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd demo
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-tui
````

Then, edit your `main.rs` with the basic template.

````rs@hello_world_tui.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
// import the prelude to get access to the `rsx!` macro and the `Scope` and `Element` types
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // launch the app in the terminal
    dioxus_tui::launch(App);
}

// create a component that renders a div with the text "Hello, world!"
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}

````

To run our app:

````shell
cargo run
````

Press "ctrl-c" to close the app. To switch from "ctrl-c" to just "q" to quit you can launch the app with a configuration to disable the default quit and use the root TuiContext to quit on your own.

````rs@hello_world_tui_no_ctrl_c.rs
// todo remove deprecated
#![allow(non_snake_case, deprecated)]

use dioxus::events::{KeyCode, KeyboardEvent};
use dioxus::prelude::*;
use dioxus_tui::TuiContext;

fn main() {
    dioxus_tui::launch_cfg(
        App,
        dioxus_tui::Config::new()
            .without_ctrl_c_quit()
            // Some older terminals only support 16 colors or ANSI colors
            // If your terminal is one of these, change this to BaseColors or ANSI
            .with_rendering_mode(dioxus_tui::RenderingMode::Rgb),
    );
}

fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let tui_ctx: TuiContext = cx.consume_context().unwrap();

    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            width: "100%",
            height: "10px",
            background_color: "red",
            justify_content: "center",
            align_items: "center",
            onkeydown: move |k: KeyboardEvent| if let KeyCode::Q = k.key_code {
                tui_ctx.quit();
            },

            "Hello world!"
        }
    })
}

````
# Mobile App

Build a mobile app with Dioxus!

Example: [Todo App](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/blob/master/ios_demo)

## Support

Mobile is currently the least-supported renderer target for Dioxus. Mobile apps are rendered with either the platform's WebView or experimentally through [WGPU](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz). WebView doesn't support animations, transparency, and native widgets.

Mobile support is currently best suited for CRUD-style apps, ideally for internal teams who need to develop quickly but don't care much about animations or native widgets.

This guide is primarily targeted at iOS apps, however, you can follow it while using the `android` guide in `cargo-mobile`.

## Getting Set up

Getting set up with mobile can be quite challenging. The tooling here isn't great (yet) and might take some hacking around to get things working. macOS M1 is broadly unexplored and might not work for you.

We're going to be using `cargo-mobile` to build for mobile. First, install it:

````shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/BrainiumLLC/cargo-mobile
````

And then initialize your app for the right platform. Use the `winit` template for now. Right now, there's no "Dioxus" template in cargo-mobile.

````shell
cargo mobile init
````

We're going to completely clear out the `dependencies` it generates for us, swapping out `winit` with `dioxus-mobile`.

````toml

[package]
name = "dioxus-ios-demo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = []
edition = "2018"


# leave the `lib` declaration
[lib]
crate-type = ["staticlib", "cdylib", "rlib"]


# leave the binary it generates for us
[[bin]]
name = "dioxus-ios-demo-desktop"
path = "gen/bin/desktop.rs"

# clear all the dependencies
[dependencies]
mobile-entry-point = "0.1.0"
dioxus = { version = "*"}
dioxus-desktop = { version = "*" }
simple_logger = "*"
````

Edit your `lib.rs`:

````rust
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    dioxus_desktop::launch(app);
}

fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx!{
        div {
            "hello world!"
        }
    })
}
````
# Describing the UI

Dioxus is a *declarative* framework. This means that instead of telling Dioxus what to do (e.g. to "create an element" or "set the color to red") we simply *declare* what we want the UI to look like using RSX.

You have already seen a simple example of RSX syntax in the "hello world" application:

````rs@hello_world_desktop.rs
// define a component that renders a div with the text "Hello, world!"
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}
````

Here, we use the `rsx!` macro to *declare* that we want a `div` element, containing the text `"Hello, world!"`. Dioxus takes the RSX and constructs a UI from it.

## RSX Features

RSX is very similar to HTML in that it describes elements with attributes and children. Here's an empty `div` element in RSX, as well as the resulting HTML:

````rs@rsx_overview.rs
cx.render(rsx!(div {
// attributes / listeners
// children
}))
````

````html
<div></div>
````

### Attributes

Attributes (and [listeners](../interactivity/index.md)) modify the behavior or appearance of the element they are attached to. They are specified inside the `{}` brackets, using the `name: value` syntax. You can provide the value as a literal in the RSX:

````rs@rsx_overview.rs
cx.render(rsx!(a {
href: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
class: "primary_button",
color: "red",
}))
````

````html
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" class="primary_button" autofocus="true" style="color: red"></a>
````

 > 
 > Note: All attributes defined in `dioxus-html` follow the snake_case naming convention. They transform their `snake_case` names to HTML's `camelCase` attributes.

 > 
 > Note: Styles can be used directly outside of the `style:` attribute. In the above example, `color: "red"` is turned into `style="color: red"`.

#### Custom Attributes

Dioxus has a pre-configured set of attributes that you can use. RSX is validated at compile time to make sure you didn't specify an invalid attribute. If you want to override this behavior with a custom attribute name, specify the attribute in quotes:

````rs@rsx_overview.rs
cx.render(rsx!(b {
    "customAttribute": "value",
}))
````

````html
<b customAttribute="value">
</b>
````

### Interpolation

Similarly to how you can [format](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello/print/fmt.html) Rust strings, you can also interpolate in RSX text. Use `{variable}` to Display the value of a variable in a string, or `{variable:?}` to use the Debug representation:

````rs@rsx_overview.rs
let coordinates = (42, 0);
let country = "es";
cx.render(rsx!(div {
class: "country-{country}",
"position": "{coordinates:?}",
// arbitrary expressions are allowed,
// as long as they don't contain `{}`
div {
    "{country.to_uppercase()}"
},
div {
    "{7*6}"
},
// {} can be escaped with {{}}
div {
    "{{}}"
},
}))
````

````html
<div class="country-es" position="(42, 0)">
    <div>ES</div>
    <div>42</div>
    <div>{}</div>
</div>
````

### Children

To add children to an element, put them inside the `{}` brackets after all attributes and listeners in the element. They can be other elements, text, or [components](components.md). For example, you could have an `ol` (ordered list) element, containing 3 `li` (list item) elements, each of which contains some text:

````rs@rsx_overview.rs
cx.render(rsx!(ol {
li {"First Item"}
li {"Second Item"}
li {"Third Item"}
}))
````

````html
<ol>
    <li>First Item</li>
    <li>Second Item</li>
    <li>Third Item</li>
</ol>
````

### Fragments

You can render multiple elements at the top level of `rsx!` and they will be automatically grouped.

````rs@rsx_overview.rs
cx.render(rsx!(
p {"First Item"},
p {"Second Item"},
))
````

````html
<p>First Item</p>
<p>Second Item</p>
````

### Expressions

You can include arbitrary Rust expressions as children within RSX that implements [IntoDynNode](https://docs.rs/dioxus-core/0.3/dioxus_core/trait.IntoDynNode.html). This is useful for displaying data from an [iterator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch13-02-iterators.html#processing-a-series-of-items-with-iterators):

````rs@rsx_overview.rs
let text = "Dioxus";
cx.render(rsx!(span {
text.to_uppercase(),
// create a list of text from 0 to 9
(0..10).map(|i| rsx!{ i.to_string() })
}))
````

````html
<span>DIOXUS0123456789</span>
````

### Loops

In addition to iterators you can also use for loops directly within RSX:

````rs@rsx_overview.rs
cx.render(rsx!{
// use a for loop where the body itself is RSX
div {
    // create a list of text from 0 to 9
    for i in 0..3 {
        // NOTE: the body of the loop is RSX not a rust statement
        div {
            "{i}"
        }
    }
}
// iterator equivalent
div {
    (0..3).map(|i| rsx!{ div { "{i}" } })
}
})
````

````html
<div>0</div>
<div>1</div>
<div>2</div>
<div>0</div>
<div>1</div>
<div>2</div>
````

### If statements

You can also use if statements without an else branch within RSX:

````rs@rsx_overview.rs
cx.render(rsx!{
// use if statements without an else
if true {
    rsx!(div { "true" })
}
})
````

````html
<div>true</div>
````
# Special Attributes

While most attributes are simply passed on to the HTML, some have special behaviors.

## The HTML Escape Hatch

If you're working with pre-rendered assets, output from templates, or output from a JS library, then you might want to pass HTML directly instead of going through Dioxus. In these instances, reach for `dangerous_inner_html`.

For example, shipping a markdown-to-Dioxus converter might significantly bloat your final application size. Instead, you'll want to pre-render your markdown to HTML and then include the HTML directly in your output. We use this approach for the [Dioxus homepage](https://dioxuslabs.com):

````rs@dangerous_inner_html.rs
// this should come from a trusted source
let contents = "live <b>dangerously</b>";

cx.render(rsx! {
div {
    dangerous_inner_html: "{contents}",
}
})
````

 > 
 > Note! This attribute is called "dangerous_inner_html" because it is **dangerous** to pass it data you don't trust. If you're not careful, you can easily expose [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attacks to your users.
 > 
 > If you're handling untrusted input, make sure to sanitize your HTML before passing it into `dangerous_inner_html` – or just pass it to a Text Element to escape any HTML tags.

## Boolean Attributes

Most attributes, when rendered, will be rendered exactly as the input you provided. However, some attributes are considered "boolean" attributes and just their presence determines whether they affect the output. For these attributes, a provided value of `"false"` will cause them to be removed from the target element.

So this RSX wouldn't actually render the `hidden` attribute:

````rs@boolean_attribute.rs
cx.render(rsx! {
div {
    hidden: "false",
    "hello"
}
})
````

````html
<div>hello</div>
````

Not all attributes work like this however. *Only the following attributes* have this behavior:

* `allowfullscreen`
* `allowpaymentrequest`
* `async`
* `autofocus`
* `autoplay`
* `checked`
* `controls`
* `default`
* `defer`
* `disabled`
* `formnovalidate`
* `hidden`
* `ismap`
* `itemscope`
* `loop`
* `multiple`
* `muted`
* `nomodule`
* `novalidate`
* `open`
* `playsinline`
* `readonly`
* `required`
* `reversed`
* `selected`
* `truespeed`

For any other attributes, a value of `"false"` will be sent directly to the DOM.
# Components

Just like you wouldn't want to write a complex program in a single, long, `main` function, you shouldn't build a complex UI in a single `App` function. Instead, you should break down the functionality of an app in logical parts called components.

A component is a Rust function, named in UpperCamelCase, that takes a `Scope` parameter and returns an `Element` describing the UI it wants to render. In fact, our `App` function is a component!

````rs@hello_world_desktop.rs
// define a component that renders a div with the text "Hello, world!"
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}
````

 > 
 > You'll probably want to add `#![allow(non_snake_case)]` to the top of your crate to avoid warnings about UpperCamelCase component names

A Component is responsible for some rendering task – typically, rendering an isolated part of the user interface. For example, you could have an `About` component that renders a short description of Dioxus Labs:

````rs@components.rs
pub fn About(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx!(p {
        b {"Dioxus Labs"}
        " An Open Source project dedicated to making Rust UI wonderful."
    }))
}
````

Then, you can render your component in another component, similarly to how elements are rendered:

````rs@components.rs
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        About {},
        About {},
    })
}
````

![Screenshot containing the About component twice](/assets/blog/release-03/screenshot_about_component.png)

 > 
 > At this point, it might seem like components are nothing more than functions. However, as you learn more about the features of Dioxus, you'll see that they are actually more powerful!
# Component Props

Just like you can pass arguments to a function, you can pass props to a component that customize its behavior! The components we've seen so far didn't accept any props – so let's write some components that do.

## derive(Props)

Component props are a single struct annotated with `#[derive(Props)]`. For a component to accept props, the type of its argument must be `Scope<YourPropsStruct>`. Then, you can access the value of the props using `cx.props`.

There are 2 flavors of Props structs:

* Owned props:
  * Don't have an associated lifetime
  * Implement `PartialEq`, allow for memoization (if the props don't change, Dioxus won't re-render the component)
* Borrowed props:
  * [Borrow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rust-by-example/scope/borrow.html) from a parent component
  * Cannot be memoized due to lifetime constraints

### Owned Props

Owned Props are very simple – they don't borrow anything. Example:

````rs@component_owned_props.rs
// Remember: Owned props must implement `PartialEq`!
#[derive(PartialEq, Props)]
struct LikesProps {
    score: i32,
}

fn Likes(cx: Scope<LikesProps>) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "This post has ",
            b { "{cx.props.score}" },
            " likes"
        }
    })
}
````

You can then pass prop values to the component the same way you would pass attributes to an element:

````rs@component_owned_props.rs
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        Likes {
            score: 42,
        },
    })
}
````

![Screenshot: Likes component](/assets/blog/release-03/component_owned_props_screenshot.png)

### Borrowed Props

Owned props work well if your props are easy to copy around – like a single number. But what if we need to pass a larger data type, like a String from an `App` Component to a `TitleCard` subcomponent? A naive solution might be to [`.clone()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html) the String, creating a copy of it for the subcomponent – but this would be inefficient, especially for larger Strings.

Rust allows for something more efficient – borrowing the String as a `&str` – this is what Borrowed Props are for!

````rs@component_borrowed_props.rs
#[derive(Props)]
struct TitleCardProps<'a> {
    title: &'a str,
}

fn TitleCard<'a>(cx: Scope<'a, TitleCardProps<'a>>) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        h1 { "{cx.props.title}" }
    })
}
````

We can then use the component like this:

````rs@component_borrowed_props.rs
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let hello = "Hello Dioxus!";

    cx.render(rsx!(TitleCard { title: hello }))
}
````

![Screenshot: TitleCard component](/assets/blog/release-03/component_borrowed_props_screenshot.png)

Borrowed props can be very useful, but they do not allow for memorization so they will *always* rerun when the parent scope is rerendered. Because of this Borrowed Props should be reserved for components that are cheap to rerun or places where cloning data is an issue. Using Borrowed Props everywhere will result in large parts of your app rerunning every interaction.

## Prop Options

The `#[derive(Props)]` macro has some features that let you customize the behavior of props.

### Optional Props

You can create optional fields by using the `Option<…>` type for a field:

````rs@component_props_options.rs
#[derive(Props)]
struct OptionalProps<'a> {
    title: &'a str,
    subtitle: Option<&'a str>,
}

fn Title<'a>(cx: Scope<'a, OptionalProps>) -> Element<'a> {
    cx.render(rsx!(h1{
        "{cx.props.title}: ",
        cx.props.subtitle.unwrap_or("No subtitle provided"),
    }))
}
````

Then, you can choose to either provide them or not:

````rs@component_props_options.rs
Title {
title: "Some Title",
},
Title {
title: "Some Title",
subtitle: "Some Subtitle",
},
// Providing an Option explicitly won't compile though:
// Title {
//     title: "Some Title",
//     subtitle: None,
// },
````

### Explicitly Required `Option`s

If you want to explicitly require an `Option`, and not an optional prop, you can annotate it with `#[props(!optional)]`:

````rs@component_props_options.rs
#[derive(Props)]
struct ExplicitOptionProps<'a> {
    title: &'a str,
    #[props(!optional)]
    subtitle: Option<&'a str>,
}

fn ExplicitOption<'a>(cx: Scope<'a, ExplicitOptionProps>) -> Element<'a> {
    cx.render(rsx!(h1 {
        "{cx.props.title}: ",
        cx.props.subtitle.unwrap_or("No subtitle provided"),
    }))
}
````

Then, you have to explicitly pass either `Some("str")` or `None`:

````rs@component_props_options.rs
ExplicitOption {
title: "Some Title",
subtitle: None,
},
ExplicitOption {
title: "Some Title",
subtitle: Some("Some Title"),
},
// This won't compile:
// ExplicitOption {
//     title: "Some Title",
// },
````

### Default Props

You can use `#[props(default = 42)]` to make a field optional and specify its default value:

````rs@component_props_options.rs
#[derive(PartialEq, Props)]
struct DefaultProps {
    // default to 42 when not provided
    #[props(default = 42)]
    number: i64,
}

fn DefaultComponent(cx: Scope<DefaultProps>) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx!(h1 { "{cx.props.number}" }))
}
````

Then, similarly to optional props, you don't have to provide it:

````rs@component_props_options.rs
DefaultComponent {
number: 5,
},
DefaultComponent {},
````

### Automatic Conversion with `.into`

It is common for Rust functions to accept `impl Into<SomeType>` rather than just `SomeType` to support a wider range of parameters. If you want similar functionality with props, you can use `#[props(into)]`. For example, you could add it on a `String` prop – and `&str` will also be automatically accepted, as it can be converted into `String`:

````rs@component_props_options.rs
#[derive(PartialEq, Props)]
struct IntoProps {
    #[props(into)]
    string: String,
}

fn IntoComponent(cx: Scope<IntoProps>) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx!(h1 { "{cx.props.string}" }))
}
````

Then, you can use it so:

````rs@component_props_options.rs
IntoComponent {
string: "some &str",
},
````

## The inline_props macro

So far, every Component function we've seen had a corresponding ComponentProps struct to pass in props. This was quite verbose... Wouldn't it be nice to have props as simple function arguments? Then we wouldn't need to define a Props struct, and instead of typing `cx.props.whatever`, we could just use `whatever` directly!

`inline_props` allows you to do just that. Instead of typing the "full" version:

````rust
#[derive(Props, PartialEq)]
struct TitleCardProps {
    title: String,
}

fn TitleCard(cx: Scope<TitleCardProps>) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx!{
        h1 { "{cx.props.title}" }
    })
}
````

...you can define a function that accepts props as arguments. Then, just annotate it with `#[inline_props]`, and the macro will turn it into a regular Component for you:

````rust
#[inline_props]
fn TitleCard(cx: Scope, title: String) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx!{
        h1 { "{title}" }
    })
}
````

 > 
 > While the new Component is shorter and easier to read, this macro should not be used by library authors since you have less control over Prop documentation.
# Component Children

In some cases, you may wish to create a component that acts as a container for some other content, without the component needing to know what that content is. To achieve this, create a prop of type `Element`:

````rs@component_element_props.rs
#[derive(Props)]
struct ClickableProps<'a> {
    href: &'a str,
    body: Element<'a>,
}

fn Clickable<'a>(cx: Scope<'a, ClickableProps<'a>>) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx!(
        a {
            href: "{cx.props.href}",
            class: "fancy-button",
            &cx.props.body
        }
    ))
}
````

Then, when rendering the component, you can pass in the output of `cx.render(rsx!(...))`:

````rs@component_element_props.rs
cx.render(rsx! {
    Clickable {
        href: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-M2hs3sXGo",
        body: cx.render(rsx!("How to " i {"not"} " be seen")),
    }
})
````

 > 
 > Note: Since `Element<'a>` is a borrowed prop, there will be no memoization.

 > 
 > Warning: While it may compile, do not include the same `Element` more than once in the RSX. The resulting behavior is unspecified.

## The children field

Rather than passing the RSX through a regular prop, you may wish to accept children similarly to how elements can have children. The "magic" `children` prop lets you achieve this:

````rs@component_children.rs
#[derive(Props)]
struct ClickableProps<'a> {
    href: &'a str,
    children: Element<'a>,
}

fn Clickable<'a>(cx: Scope<'a, ClickableProps<'a>>) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx!(
        a {
            href: "{cx.props.href}",
            class: "fancy-button",
            &cx.props.children
        }
    ))
}
````

This makes using the component much simpler: simply put the RSX inside the `{}` brackets – and there is no need for a `render` call or another macro!

````rs@component_children.rs
cx.render(rsx! {
    Clickable {
        href: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-M2hs3sXGo",
        "How to " i {"not"} " be seen"
    }
})
````
# Interactivity

So far, we've learned how to describe the structure and properties of our user interfaces. However, most interfaces need to be interactive in order to be useful. In this chapter, we describe how to make a Dioxus app that responds to the user.
# Event Handlers

Event handlers are used to respond to user actions. For example, an event handler could be triggered when the user clicks, scrolls, moves the mouse, or types a character.

Event handlers are attached to elements. For example, we usually don't care about all the clicks that happen within an app, only those on a particular button.

Event handlers are similar to regular attributes, but their name usually starts with `on`- and they accept closures as values. The closure will be called whenever the event it listens for is triggered and will be passed that event.

For example, to handle clicks on an element, we can specify an `onclick` handler:

````rs@event_click.rs
cx.render(rsx! {
button {
    onclick: move |event| println!("Clicked! Event: {event:?}"),
    "click me!"
}
})
````

## The Event object

Event handlers receive an [`Event`](https://docs.rs/dioxus-core/latest/dioxus_core/struct.Event.html) object containing information about the event. Different types of events contain different types of data. For example, mouse-related events contain [`MouseData`](https://docs.rs/dioxus/latest/dioxus/events/struct.MouseData.html), which tells you things like where the mouse was clicked and what mouse buttons were used.

In the example above, this event data was logged to the terminal:

````
Clicked! Event: UiEvent { bubble_state: Cell { value: true }, data: MouseData { coordinates: Coordinates { screen: (242.0, 256.0), client: (26.0, 17.0), element: (16.0, 7.0), page: (26.0, 17.0) }, modifiers: (empty), held_buttons: EnumSet(), trigger_button: Some(Primary) } }
Clicked! Event: UiEvent { bubble_state: Cell { value: true }, data: MouseData { coordinates: Coordinates { screen: (242.0, 256.0), client: (26.0, 17.0), element: (16.0, 7.0), page: (26.0, 17.0) }, modifiers: (empty), held_buttons: EnumSet(), trigger_button: Some(Primary) } }
````

To learn what the different event types for HTML provide, read the [events module docs](https://docs.rs/dioxus-html/latest/dioxus_html/events/index.html).

### Event propagation

Some events will trigger first on the element the event originated at upward. For example, a click event on a `button` inside a `div` would first trigger the button's event listener and then the div's event listener.

 > 
 > For more information about event propigation see [the mdn docs on event bubling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_bubbling)

If you want to prevent this behavior, you can call `stop_propogation()` on the event:

````rs@event_nested.rs
cx.render(rsx! {
div {
    onclick: move |_event| {},
    "outer",
    button {
        onclick: move |event| {
            // now, outer won't be triggered
            event.stop_propagation();
        },
        "inner"
    }
}
})
````

## Prevent Default

Some events have a default behavior. For keyboard events, this might be entering the typed character. For mouse events, this might be selecting some text.

In some instances, might want to avoid this default behavior. For this, you can add the `prevent_default` attribute with the name of the handler whose default behavior you want to stop. This attribute is special: you can attach it multiple times for multiple attributes:

````rs@event_prevent_default.rs
cx.render(rsx! {
input {
    prevent_default: "oninput",
    prevent_default: "onclick",
}
})
````

Any event handlers will still be called.

 > 
 > Normally, in React or JavaScript, you'd call "preventDefault" on the event in the callback. Dioxus does *not* currently support this behavior. Note: this means you cannot conditionally prevent default behavior based on the data in the event.

## Handler Props

Sometimes, you might want to make a component that accepts an event handler. A simple example would be a `FancyButton` component, which accepts an `on_click` handler:

````rs@event_handler_prop.rs
#[derive(Props)]
pub struct FancyButtonProps<'a> {
    on_click: EventHandler<'a, MouseEvent>,
}

pub fn FancyButton<'a>(cx: Scope<'a, FancyButtonProps<'a>>) -> Element<'a> {
    cx.render(rsx!(button {
        class: "fancy-button",
        onclick: move |evt| cx.props.on_click.call(evt),
        "click me pls."
    }))
}
````

Then, you can use it like any other handler:

````rs@event_handler_prop.rs
cx.render(rsx! {
    FancyButton {
        on_click: move |event| println!("Clicked! {event:?}")
    }
})
````

 > 
 > Note: just like any other attribute, you can name the handlers anything you want! Though they must start with `on`, for the prop to be automatically turned into an `EventHandler` at the call site.
 > 
 > You can also put custom data in the event, rather than e.g. `MouseData`
# Hooks and Component State

So far our components have had no state like a normal rust functions. However, in a UI component, it is often useful to have stateful functionality to build user interactions. For example, you might want to track whether the user has opened a drop-down, and render different things accordingly.

Hooks allow us to create state in our components. Hooks are Rust functions that take a reference to `ScopeState` (in a component, you can pass `cx`), and provide you with functionality and state.

## use_state Hook

[`use_state`](https://docs.rs/dioxus/latest/dioxus/prelude/fn.use_state.html) is one of the simplest hooks.

* You provide a closure that determines the initial value
* `use_state` gives you the current value, and a way to update it by setting it to something else
* When the value updates, `use_state` makes the component re-render, and provides you with the new value

For example, you might have seen the counter example, in which state (a number) is tracked using the `use_state` hook:

````rs@hooks_counter.rs
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    // count will be initialized to 0 the first time the component is rendered
    let mut count = use_state(cx, || 0);

    cx.render(rsx!(
        h1 { "High-Five counter: {count}" }
        button {
            onclick: move |_| {
                // changing the count will cause the component to re-render
                count += 1
            },
            "Up high!"
        }
        button {
            onclick: move |_| {
                // changing the count will cause the component to re-render
                count -= 1
            },
            "Down low!"
        }
    ))
}
````

![Screenshot: counter app](/assets/blog/release-03/counter.png)

Every time the component's state changes, it re-renders, and the component function is called, so you can describe what you want the new UI to look like. You don't have to worry about "changing" anything – just describe what you want in terms of the state, and Dioxus will take care of the rest!

 > 
 > `use_state` returns your value wrapped in a smart pointer of type [`UseState`](https://docs.rs/dioxus/latest/dioxus/prelude/struct.UseState.html). This is why you can both read the value and update it, even within an event handler.

You can use multiple hooks in the same component if you want:

````rs@hooks_counter_two_state.rs
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let mut count_a = use_state(cx, || 0);
    let mut count_b = use_state(cx, || 0);

    cx.render(rsx!(
        h1 { "Counter_a: {count_a}" }
        button { onclick: move |_| count_a += 1, "a++" }
        button { onclick: move |_| count_a -= 1, "a--" }
        h1 { "Counter_b: {count_b}" }
        button { onclick: move |_| count_b += 1, "b++" }
        button { onclick: move |_| count_b -= 1, "b--" }
    ))
}
````

![Screenshot: app with two counters](/assets/blog/release-03/counter_two_state.png)

## Rules of Hooks

The above example might seem a bit magic, since Rust functions are typically not associated with state. Dioxus allows hooks to maintain state across renders through a reference to `ScopeState`, which is why you must pass `&cx` to them.

But how can Dioxus differentiate between multiple hooks in the same component? As you saw in the second example, both `use_state` functions were called with the same parameters, so how come they can return different things when the counters are different?

````rs@hooks_counter_two_state.rs
let mut count_a = use_state(cx, || 0);
let mut count_b = use_state(cx, || 0);
````

This is only possible because the two hooks are always called in the same order, so Dioxus knows which is which. Because the order you call hooks matters, you must follow certain rules when using hooks:

1. Hooks may be only used in components or other hooks (we'll get to that later)
1. On every call to the component function
   1. The same hooks must be called
   1. In the same order
1. Hooks name's should start with `use_` so you don't accidentally confuse them with regular functions

These rules mean that there are certain things you can't do with hooks:

### No Hooks in Conditionals

````rs@hooks_bad.rs
// ❌ don't call hooks in conditionals!
// We must ensure that the same hooks will be called every time
// But `if` statements only run if the conditional is true!
// So we might violate rule 2.
if you_are_happy && you_know_it {
let something = use_state(cx, || "hands");
println!("clap your {something}")
}

// ✅ instead, *always* call use_state
// You can put other stuff in the conditional though
let something = use_state(cx, || "hands");
if you_are_happy && you_know_it {
println!("clap your {something}")
}
````

### No Hooks in Closures

````rs@hooks_bad.rs
// ❌ don't call hooks inside closures!
// We can't guarantee that the closure, if used, will be called in the same order every time
let _a = || {
let b = use_state(cx, || 0);
b.get()
};

// ✅ instead, move hook `b` outside
let b = use_state(cx, || 0);
let _a = || b.get();
````

### No Hooks in Loops

````rs@hooks_bad.rs
// `names` is a Vec<&str>

// ❌ Do not use hooks in loops!
// In this case, if the length of the Vec changes, we break rule 2
for _name in &names {
let is_selected = use_state(cx, || false);
println!("selected: {is_selected}");
}

// ✅ Instead, use a hashmap with use_ref
let selection_map = use_ref(cx, HashMap::<&str, bool>::new);

for name in &names {
let is_selected = selection_map.read()[name];
println!("selected: {is_selected}");
}
````

## use_ref Hook

`use_state` is great for tracking simple values. However, you may notice in the [`UseState` API](https://docs.rs/dioxus/latest/dioxus/hooks/struct.UseState.html) that the only way to modify its value is to replace it with something else (e.g., by calling `set`, or through one of the `+=`, `-=` operators). This works well when it is cheap to construct a value (such as any primitive). But what if you want to maintain more complex data in the components state?

For example, suppose we want to maintain a `Vec` of values. If we stored it with `use_state`, the only way to add a new value to the list would be to create a new `Vec` with the additional value, and put it in the state. This is expensive! We want to modify the existing `Vec` instead.

Thankfully, there is another hook for that, `use_ref`! It is similar to `use_state`, but it lets you get a mutable reference to the contained data.

Here's a simple example that keeps a list of events in a `use_ref`. We can acquire write access to the state with `.with_mut()`, and then just `.push` a new value to the state:

````rs@hooks_use_ref.rs
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let list = use_ref(cx, Vec::new);

    cx.render(rsx!(
        p { "Current list: {list.read():?}" }
        button {
            onclick: move |event| {
                list.with_mut(|list| list.push(event));
            },
            "Click me!"
        }
    ))
}
````

 > 
 > The return values of `use_state` and `use_ref` (`UseState` and `UseRef`, respectively) are in some ways similar to [`Cell`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/) and [`RefCell`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html) – they provide interior mutability. However, these Dioxus wrappers also ensure that the component gets re-rendered whenever you change the state.
# User Input

Interfaces often need to provide a way to input data: e.g. text, numbers, checkboxes, etc. In Dioxus, there are two ways you can work with user input.

## Controlled Inputs

With controlled inputs, you are directly in charge of the state of the input. This gives you a lot of flexibility, and makes it easy to keep things in sync. For example, this is how you would create a controlled text input:

````rs@input_controlled.rs
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let name = use_state(cx, || "bob".to_string());

    cx.render(rsx! {
        input {
            // we tell the component what to render
            value: "{name}",
            // and what to do when the value changes
            oninput: move |evt| name.set(evt.value.clone()),
        }
    })
}
````

Notice the flexibility – you can:

* Also display the same contents in another element, and they will be in sync
* Transform the input every time it is modified (e.g. to make sure it is upper case)
* Validate the input every time it changes
* Have custom logic happening when the input changes (e.g. network request for autocompletion)
* Programmatically change the value (e.g. a "randomize" button that fills the input with nonsense)

## Uncontrolled Inputs

As an alternative to controlled inputs, you can simply let the platform keep track of the input values. If we don't tell a HTML input what content it should have, it will be editable anyway (this is built into the browser). This approach can be more performant, but less flexible. For example, it's harder to keep the input in sync with another element.

Since you don't necessarily have the current value of the uncontrolled input in state, you can access it either by listening to `oninput` events (similarly to controlled components), or, if the input is part of a form, you can access the form data in the form events (e.g. `oninput` or `onsubmit`):

````rs@input_uncontrolled.rs
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        form {
            onsubmit: move |event| {
                println!("Submitted! {event:?}")
            },
            input { name: "name", },
            input { name: "age", },
            input { name: "date", },
            input { r#type: "submit", },
        }
    })
}
````

````
Submitted! UiEvent { data: FormData { value: "", values: {"age": "very old", "date": "1966", "name": "Fred"} } }
````
# Sharing State

Often, multiple components need to access the same state. Depending on your needs, there are several ways to implement this.

## Lifting State

One approach to share state between components is to "lift" it up to the nearest common ancestor. This means putting the `use_state` hook in a parent component, and passing the needed values down as props.

Suppose we want to build a meme editor. We want to have an input to edit the meme caption, but also a preview of the meme with the caption. Logically, the meme and the input are 2 separate components, but they need access to the same state (the current caption).

 > 
 > Of course, in this simple example, we could write everything in one component – but it is better to split everything out in smaller components to make the code more reusable, maintainable, and performant (this is even more important for larger, complex apps).

We start with a `Meme` component, responsible for rendering a meme with a given caption:

````rs@meme_editor.rs
#[inline_props]
fn Meme<'a>(cx: Scope<'a>, caption: &'a str) -> Element<'a> {
    let container_style = r#"
        position: relative;
        width: fit-content;
    "#;

    let caption_container_style = r#"
        position: absolute;
        bottom: 0;
        left: 0;
        right: 0;
        padding: 16px 8px;
    "#;

    let caption_style = r"
        font-size: 32px;
        margin: 0;
        color: white;
        text-align: center;
    ";

    cx.render(rsx!(
        div {
            style: "{container_style}",
            img {
                src: "https://i.imgflip.com/2zh47r.jpg",
                height: "500px",
            },
            div {
                style: "{caption_container_style}",
                p {
                    style: "{caption_style}",
                    "{caption}"
                }
            }
        }
    ))
}
````

 > 
 > Note that the `Meme` component is unaware where the caption is coming from – it could be stored in `use_state`, `use_ref`, or a constant. This ensures that it is very reusable – the same component can be used for a meme gallery without any changes!

We also create a caption editor, completely decoupled from the meme. The caption editor must not store the caption itself – otherwise, how will we provide it to the `Meme` component? Instead, it should accept the current caption as a prop, as well as an event handler to delegate input events to:

````rs@meme_editor.rs
#[inline_props]
fn CaptionEditor<'a>(
    cx: Scope<'a>,
    caption: &'a str,
    on_input: EventHandler<'a, FormEvent>,
) -> Element<'a> {
    let input_style = r"
        border: none;
        background: cornflowerblue;
        padding: 8px 16px;
        margin: 0;
        border-radius: 4px;
        color: white;
    ";

    cx.render(rsx!(input {
        style: "{input_style}",
        value: "{caption}",
        oninput: move |event| on_input.call(event),
    }))
}
````

Finally, a third component will render the other two as children. It will be responsible for keeping the state and passing down the relevant props.

````rs@meme_editor.rs
fn MemeEditor(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let container_style = r"
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        gap: 16px;
        margin: 0 auto;
        width: fit-content;
    ";

    let caption = use_state(cx, || "me waiting for my rust code to compile".to_string());

    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            style: "{container_style}",
            h1 { "Meme Editor" },
            Meme {
                caption: caption,
            },
            CaptionEditor {
                caption: caption,
                on_input: move |event: FormEvent| {caption.set(event.value.clone());},
            },
        }
    })
}
````

## Using Context

Sometimes, some state needs to be shared between multiple components far down the tree, and passing it down through props is very inconvenient.

Suppose now that we want to implement a dark mode toggle for our app. To achieve this, we will make every component select styling depending on whether dark mode is enabled or not.

 > 
 > Note: we're choosing this approach for the sake of an example. There are better ways to implement dark mode (e.g. using CSS variables). Let's pretend CSS variables don't exist – welcome to 2013!

Now, we could write another `use_state` in the top component, and pass `is_dark_mode` down to every component through props. But think about what will happen as the app grows in complexity – almost every component that renders any CSS is going to need to know if dark mode is enabled or not – so they'll all need the same dark mode prop. And every parent component will need to pass it down to them. Imagine how messy and verbose that would get, especially if we had components several levels deep!

Dioxus offers a better solution than this "prop drilling" – providing context. The [`use_context_provider`](https://docs.rs/dioxus-hooks/latest/dioxus_hooks/fn.use_context_provider.html) hook is similar to `use_ref`, but it makes it available through [`use_context`](https://docs.rs/dioxus-hooks/latest/dioxus_hooks/fn.use_context.html) for all children components.

First, we have to create a struct for our dark mode configuration:

````rs@meme_editor_dark_mode.rs
struct DarkMode(bool);
````

Now, in a top-level component (like `App`), we can provide the `DarkMode` context to all children components:

````rs@meme_editor_dark_mode.rs
use_shared_state_provider(cx, || DarkMode(false));
````

As a result, any child component of `App` (direct or not), can access the `DarkMode` context.

````rs@meme_editor_dark_mode.rs
let dark_mode_context = use_shared_state::<DarkMode>(cx);
````

 > 
 > `use_context` returns `Option<UseSharedState<DarkMode>>` here. If the context has been provided, the value is `Some(UseSharedState<DarkMode>)`, which you can call `.read` or `.write` on, similarly to `UseRef`. Otherwise, the value is `None`.

For example, here's how we would implement the dark mode toggle, which both reads the context (to determine what color it should render) and writes to it (to toggle dark mode):

````rs@meme_editor_dark_mode.rs
pub fn DarkModeToggle(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let dark_mode = use_shared_state::<DarkMode>(cx).unwrap();

    let style = if dark_mode.read().0 {
        "color:white"
    } else {
        ""
    };

    cx.render(rsx!(label {
        style: "{style}",
        "Dark Mode",
        input {
            r#type: "checkbox",
            oninput: move |event| {
                let is_enabled = event.value == "true";
                dark_mode.write().0 = is_enabled;
            },
        },
    }))
}
````
# Custom Hooks

Hooks are a great way to encapsulate business logic. If none of the existing hooks work for your problem, you can write your own.

## Composing Hooks

To avoid repetition, you can encapsulate business logic based on existing hooks to create a new hook.

For example, if many components need to access an `AppSettings` struct, you can create a "shortcut" hook:

````rs@hooks_composed.rs
fn use_settings(cx: &ScopeState) -> UseSharedState<AppSettings> {
    use_shared_state::<AppSettings>(cx).expect("App settings not provided")
}
````

## Custom Hook Logic

You can use [`cx.use_hook`](https://docs.rs/dioxus/latest/dioxus/prelude/struct.Scope.html#method.use_hook) to build your own hooks. In fact, this is what all the standard hooks are built on!

`use_hook` accepts a single closure for initializing the hook. It will be only run the first time the component is rendered. The return value of that closure will be used as the value of the hook – Dioxus will take it, and store it for as long as the component is alive. On every render (not just the first one!), you will get a reference to this value.

 > 
 > Note: You can implement [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html) for your hook value – it will be dropped then the component is unmounted (no longer in the UI)

Inside the initialization closure, you will typically make calls to other `cx` methods. For example:

* The `use_state` hook tracks state in the hook value, and uses [`cx.schedule_update`](https://docs.rs/dioxus/latest/dioxus/prelude/struct.Scope.html#method.schedule_update) to make Dioxus re-render the component whenever it changes.
* The `use_context` hook calls [`cx.consume_context`](https://docs.rs/dioxus/latest/dioxus/prelude/struct.Scope.html#method.consume_context) (which would be expensive to call on every render) to get some context from the scope
# Dynamic Rendering

Sometimes you want to render different things depending on the state/props. With Dioxus, just describe what you want to see using Rust control flow – the framework will take care of making the necessary changes on the fly if the state or props change!

## Conditional Rendering

To render different elements based on a condition, you could use an `if-else` statement:

````rs@conditional_rendering.rs
if *is_logged_in {
cx.render(rsx! {
    "Welcome!"
    button {
        onclick: move |_| on_log_out.call(()),
        "Log Out",
    }
})
} else {
cx.render(rsx! {
    button {
        onclick: move |_| on_log_in.call(()),
        "Log In",
    }
})
}
````

 > 
 > You could also use `match` statements, or any Rust function to conditionally render different things.

### Improving the `if-else` Example

You may have noticed some repeated code in the `if-else` example above. Repeating code like this is both bad for maintainability and performance. Dioxus will skip diffing static elements like the button, but when switching between multiple `rsx` calls it cannot perform this optimization. For this example either approach is fine, but for components with large parts that are reused between conditionals, it can be more of an issue.

We can improve this example by splitting up the dynamic parts and inserting them where they are needed.

````rs@conditional_rendering.rs
cx.render(rsx! {
// We only render the welcome message if we are logged in
// You can use if statements in the middle of a render block to conditionally render elements
if *is_logged_in {
    // Notice the body of this if statment is rsx code, not an expression
    "Welcome!"
}
button {
    // depending on the value of `is_logged_in`, we will call a different event handler
    onclick: move |_| if *is_logged_in {
        on_log_in.call(())
    }
    else{
        on_log_out.call(())
    },
    if *is_logged_in {
        // if we are logged in, the button should say "Log Out"
        "Log Out"
    } else {
        // if we are not logged in, the button should say "Log In"
        "Log In"
    }
}
})
````

### Inspecting `Element` props

Since `Element` is a `Option<VNode>`, components accepting `Element` as a prop can inspect its contents, and render different things based on that. Example:

````rs@component_children_inspect.rs
fn Clickable<'a>(cx: Scope<'a, ClickableProps<'a>>) -> Element {
    match cx.props.children {
        Some(VNode { dynamic_nodes, .. }) => {
            todo!("render some stuff")
        }
        _ => {
            todo!("render some other stuff")
        }
    }
}
````

You can't mutate the `Element`, but if you need a modified version of it, you can construct a new one based on its attributes/children/etc.

## Rendering Nothing

To render nothing, you can return `None` from a component. This is useful if you want to conditionally hide something:

````rs@conditional_rendering.rs
if *is_logged_in {
return None;
}

cx.render(rsx! {
a {
    "You must be logged in to comment"
}
})
````

This works because the `Element` type is just an alias for `Option<VNode>`

 > 
 > Again, you may use a different method to conditionally return `None`. For example the boolean's [`then()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.bool.html#method.then) function could be used.

## Rendering Lists

Often, you'll want to render a collection of components. For example, you might want to render a list of all comments on a post.

For this, Dioxus accepts iterators that produce `Element`s. So we need to:

* Get an iterator over all of our items (e.g., if you have a `Vec` of comments, iterate over it with `iter()`)
* `.map` the iterator to convert each item into a `LazyNode` using `rsx!(...)`
  * Add a unique `key` attribute to each iterator item
* Include this iterator in the final RSX (or use it inline)

Example: suppose you have a list of comments you want to render. Then, you can render them like this:

````rs@rendering_lists.rs
let comment_field = use_state(cx, String::new);
let mut next_id = use_state(cx, || 0);
let comments = use_ref(cx, Vec::<Comment>::new);

let comments_lock = comments.read();
let comments_rendered = comments_lock.iter().map(|comment| {
rsx!(CommentComponent {
    key: "{comment.id}",
    comment: comment.clone(),
})
});

cx.render(rsx!(
form {
    onsubmit: move |_| {
        comments.write().push(Comment {
            content: comment_field.get().clone(),
            id: *next_id.get(),
        });
        next_id += 1;

        comment_field.set(String::new());
    },
    input {
        value: "{comment_field}",
        oninput: |event| comment_field.set(event.value.clone()),
    }
    input {
        r#type: "submit",
    }
},
comments_rendered,
))
````

### Inline for loops

Because of how common it is to render a list of items, Dioxus provides a shorthand for this. Instead of using `.iter, `.map`, and `rsx`, you can use a `for\` loop with a body of rsx code:

````rs@rendering_lists.rs
let comment_field = use_state(cx, String::new);
let mut next_id = use_state(cx, || 0);
let comments = use_ref(cx, Vec::<Comment>::new);

cx.render(rsx!(
form {
    onsubmit: move |_| {
        comments.write().push(Comment {
            content: comment_field.get().clone(),
            id: *next_id.get(),
        });
        next_id += 1;

        comment_field.set(String::new());
    },
    input {
        value: "{comment_field}",
        oninput: |event| comment_field.set(event.value.clone()),
    }
    input {
        r#type: "submit",
    }
},
for comment in &*comments.read() {
    // Notice the body of this for loop is rsx code, not an expression
    CommentComponent {
        key: "{comment.id}",
        comment: comment.clone(),
    }
}
))
````

### The key Attribute

Every time you re-render your list, Dioxus needs to keep track of which items go where to determine what updates need to be made to the UI.

For example, suppose the `CommentComponent` had some state – e.g. a field where the user typed in a reply. If the order of comments suddenly changes, Dioxus needs to correctly associate that state with the same comment – otherwise, the user will end up replying to a different comment!

To help Dioxus keep track of list items, we need to associate each item with a unique key. In the example above, we dynamically generated the unique key. In real applications, it's more likely that the key will come from e.g. a database ID. It doesn't matter where you get the key from, as long as it meets the requirements:

* Keys must be unique in a list
* The same item should always get associated with the same key
* Keys should be relatively small (i.e. converting the entire Comment structure to a String would be a pretty bad key) so they can be compared efficiently

You might be tempted to use an item's index in the list as its key. That’s what Dioxus will use if you don’t specify a key at all. This is only acceptable if you can guarantee that the list is constant – i.e., no re-ordering, additions, or deletions.

 > 
 > Note that if you pass the key to a component you've made, it won't receive the key as a prop. It’s only used as a hint by Dioxus itself. If your component needs an ID, you have to pass it as a separate prop.
# Router

In many of your apps, you'll want to have different "scenes". For a webpage, these scenes might be the different webpages with their own content. For a desktop app, these scenes might be different views in your app.

To unify these platforms, Dioxus provides a first-party solution for scene management called Dioxus Router.

## What is it?

For an app like the Dioxus landing page (https://dioxuslabs.com), we want to have several different scenes:

* Homepage
* Blog

Each of these scenes is independent – we don't want to render both the homepage and blog at the same time.

The Dioxus router makes it easy to create these scenes. To make sure we're using the router, add the `dioxus-router` package to your `Cargo.toml`.

````shell
cargo add dioxus-router
````

## Using the router

Unlike other routers in the Rust ecosystem, our router is built declaratively. This makes it possible to compose our app layout simply by arranging components.

````rust
rsx!{
    // All of our routes will be rendered inside this Router component
    Router {
        // if the current location is "/home", render the Home component
        Route { to: "/home", Home {} }
        // if the current location is "/blog", render the Blog component
        Route { to: "/blog", Blog {} }
    }
}
````

Whenever we visit this app, we will get either the Home component or the Blog component rendered depending on which route we enter at. If neither of these routes match the current location, then nothing will render.

We can fix this one of two ways:

* A fallback 404 page

````rust
rsx!{
    Router {
        Route { to: "/home", Home {} }
        Route { to: "/blog", Blog {} }
        //  if the current location doesn't match any of the above routes, render the NotFound component
        Route { to: "", NotFound {} }
    }
}
````

* Redirect 404 to home

````rust
rsx!{
    Router {
        Route { to: "/home", Home {} }
        Route { to: "/blog", Blog {} }
        //  if the current location doesn't match any of the above routes, redirect to "/home"
        Redirect { from: "", to: "/home" }
    }
}
````

## Links

For our app to navigate these routes, we can provide clickable elements called Links. These simply wrap `<a>` elements that, when clicked, navigate the app to the given location.

````rust

This page is just a very brief overview of the router. For more information, check out [the router book](https://dioxuslabs.com/router/guide/) or some of [the router examples](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/master/examples/router.rs).
# Working with Async

Often, apps need to interact with file systems, network interfaces, hardware, or timers. This chapter provides an overview of using async code in Dioxus.

## The Runtime

By default, Dioxus-Desktop ships with the `Tokio` runtime and automatically sets everything up for you. This is currently not configurable, though it would be easy to write an integration for Dioxus desktop that uses a different asynchronous runtime.

Dioxus is not currently thread-safe, so any async code you write does *not* need to be `Send/Sync`. That means that you can use non-thread-safe structures like `Cell`, `Rc`, and `RefCell`.
# UseFuture

[`use_future`](https://docs.rs/dioxus-hooks/latest/dioxus_hooks/fn.use_future.html) lets you run an async closure, and provides you with its result.

For example, we can make an API request (using [reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/index.html)) inside `use_future`:

````rs@use_future.rs
let future = use_future(cx, (), |_| async move {
    reqwest::get("https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random")
        .await
        .unwrap()
        .json::<ApiResponse>()
        .await
});
````

The code inside `use_future` will be submitted to the Dioxus scheduler once the component has rendered.

We can use `.value()` to get the result of the future. On the first run, since there's no data ready when the component loads, its value will be `None`.  However, once the future is finished, the component will be re-rendered and the value will now be `Some(...)`, containing the return value of the closure.

We can then render that result:

````rs@use_future.rs
cx.render(match future.value() {
    Some(Ok(response)) => rsx! {
        button {
            onclick: move |_| future.restart(),
            "Click to fetch another doggo"
        }
        div {
            img {
                max_width: "500px",
                max_height: "500px",
                src: "{response.image_url}",
            }
        }
    },
    Some(Err(_)) => rsx! { div { "Loading dogs failed" } },
    None => rsx! { div { "Loading dogs..." } },
})
````

## Restarting the Future

The `UseFuture` handle provides a `restart` method. It can be used to execute the future again, producing a new value.

## Dependencies

Often, you will need to run the future again every time some value (e.g. a prop) changes. Rather than calling `restart` manually, you can provide a tuple of "dependencies" to the hook. It will automatically re-run the future when any of those dependencies change. Example:

````rs@use_future.rs
let future = use_future(cx, (breed,), |(breed,)| async move {
    reqwest::get(format!("https://dog.ceo/api/breed/{breed}/images/random"))
        .await
        .unwrap()
        .json::<ApiResponse>()
        .await
});
````
# Coroutines

Another tool in your async toolbox are coroutines. Coroutines are futures that can be manually stopped, started, paused, and resumed.

Like regular futures, code in a coroutine will run until the next `await` point before yielding. This low-level control over asynchronous tasks is quite powerful, allowing for infinitely looping tasks like WebSocket polling, background timers, and other periodic actions.

## use_coroutine

The `use_coroutine` hook allows you to create a coroutine. Most coroutines we write will be polling loops using async/await.

````rust
fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let ws: &UseCoroutine<()> = use_coroutine(cx, |rx| async move {
        // Connect to some sort of service
        let mut conn = connect_to_ws_server().await;

        // Wait for data on the service
        while let Some(msg) = conn.next().await {
            // handle messages
        }
    });
}
````

For many services, a simple async loop will handle the majority of use cases.

However, if we want to temporarily disable the coroutine, we can "pause" it using the `pause` method, and "resume" it using the `resume` method:

````rust
let sync: &UseCoroutine<()> = use_coroutine(cx, |rx| async move {
    // code for syncing
});

if sync.is_running() {
    cx.render(rsx!{
        button {
            onclick: move |_| sync.pause(),
            "Disable syncing"
        }
    })
} else {
    cx.render(rsx!{
        button {
            onclick: move |_| sync.resume(),
            "Enable syncing"
        }
    })
}
````

This pattern is where coroutines are extremely useful – instead of writing all the complicated logic for pausing our async tasks like we would with JavaScript promises, the Rust model allows us to just not poll our future.

## Yielding Values

To yield values from a coroutine, simply bring in a `UseState` handle and set the value whenever your coroutine completes its work.

The future must be `'static` – so any values captured by the task cannot carry any references to `cx`, such as a `UseState`.

You can use [to_owned](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.ToOwned.html#tymethod.to_owned) to create a clone of the hook handle which can be moved into the async closure.

````rust
let sync_status = use_state(cx, || Status::Launching);
let sync_task = use_coroutine(cx, |rx: UnboundedReceiver<SyncAction>| {
    let sync_status = sync_status.to_owned();
    async move {
        loop {
            delay_ms(1000).await;
            sync_status.set(Status::Working);
        }
    }
})
````

To make this a bit less verbose, Dioxus exports the `to_owned!` macro which will create a binding as shown above, which can be quite helpful when dealing with many values.

````rust
let sync_status = use_state(cx, || Status::Launching);
let load_status = use_state(cx, || Status::Launching);
let sync_task = use_coroutine(cx, |rx: UnboundedReceiver<SyncAction>| {
    to_owned![sync_status, load_status];
    async move {
        // ...
    }
})
````

## Sending Values

You might've noticed the `use_coroutine` closure takes an argument called `rx`. What is that? Well, a common pattern in complex apps is to handle a bunch of async code at once. With libraries like Redux Toolkit, managing multiple promises at once can be challenging and a common source of bugs.

With Coroutines, we can centralize our async logic. The `rx` parameter is an Channel that allows code external to the coroutine to send data *into* the coroutine. Instead of looping on an external service, we can loop on the channel itself, processing messages from within our app without needing to spawn a new future. To send data into the coroutine, we would call "send" on the handle.

````rust
enum ProfileUpdate {
    SetUsername(String),
    SetAge(i32)
}

let profile = use_coroutine(cx, |mut rx: UnboundedReciver<ProfileUpdate>| async move {
    let mut server = connect_to_server().await;

    while let Ok(msg) = rx.next().await {
        match msg {
            ProfileUpdate::SetUsername(name) => server.update_username(name).await,
            ProfileUpdate::SetAge(age) => server.update_age(age).await,
        }
    }
});


cx.render(rsx!{
    button {
        onclick: move |_| profile.send(ProfileUpdate::SetUsername("Bob".to_string())),
        "Update username"
    }
})
````

For sufficiently complex apps, we could build a bunch of different useful "services" that loop on channels to update the app.

````rust
let profile = use_coroutine(cx, profile_service);
let editor = use_coroutine(cx, editor_service);
let sync = use_coroutine(cx, sync_service);

async fn profile_service(rx: UnboundedReceiver<ProfileCommand>) {
    // do stuff
}

async fn sync_service(rx: UnboundedReceiver<SyncCommand>) {
    // do stuff
}

async fn editor_service(rx: UnboundedReceiver<EditorCommand>) {
    // do stuff
}
````

We can combine coroutines with [Fermi](https://docs.rs/fermi/latest/fermi/index.html) to emulate Redux Toolkit's Thunk system with much less headache. This lets us store all of our app's state *within* a task and then simply update the "view" values stored in Atoms. It cannot be understated how powerful this technique is: we get all the perks of native Rust tasks with the optimizations and ergonomics of global state. This means your *actual* state does not need to be tied up in a system like Fermi or Redux – the only Atoms that need to exist are those that are used to drive the display/UI.

````rust
static USERNAME: Atom<String> = |_| "default".to_string();

fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let atoms = use_atom_root(cx);

    use_coroutine(cx, |rx| sync_service(rx, atoms.clone()));

    cx.render(rsx!{
        Banner {}
    })
}

fn Banner(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let username = use_read(cx, USERNAME);

    cx.render(rsx!{
        h1 { "Welcome back, {username}" }
    })
}
````

Now, in our sync service, we can structure our state however we want. We only need to update the view values when ready.

````rust
enum SyncAction {
    SetUsername(String),
}

async fn sync_service(mut rx: UnboundedReceiver<SyncAction>, atoms: AtomRoot) {
    let username = atoms.write(USERNAME);
    let errors = atoms.write(ERRORS);

    while let Ok(msg) = rx.next().await {
        match msg {
            SyncAction::SetUsername(name) => {
                if set_name_on_server(&name).await.is_ok() {
                    username.set(name);
                } else {
                    errors.make_mut().push("SetUsernameFailed");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
````

## Automatic injection into the Context API

Coroutine handles are automatically injected through the context API. You can use the `use_coroutine_handle` hook with the message type as a generic to fetch a handle.

````rust
fn Child(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let sync_task = use_coroutine_handle::<SyncAction>(cx);

    sync_task.send(SyncAction::SetUsername);
}
````
# Spawning Futures

The `use_future` and `use_coroutine` hooks are useful if you want to unconditionally spawn the future. Sometimes, though, you'll want to only spawn a future in response to an event, such as a mouse click. For example, suppose you need to send a request when the user clicks a "log in" button. For this, you can use `cx.spawn`:

````rs@spawn.rs
let logged_in = use_state(cx, || false);

let log_in = move |_| {
    cx.spawn({
        let logged_in = logged_in.to_owned();

        async move {
            let resp = reqwest::Client::new()
                .post("http://example.com/login")
                .send()
                .await;

            match resp {
                Ok(_data) => {
                    println!("Login successful!");
                    logged_in.set(true);
                }
                Err(_err) => {
                    println!(
                        "Login failed - you need a login server running on localhost:8080."
                    )
                }
            }
        }
    });
};

cx.render(rsx! {
    button {
        onclick: log_in,
        "Login",
    }
})
````

 > 
 > Note: `spawn` will always spawn a *new* future. You most likely don't want to call it on every render.

Calling `spawn` will give you a `JoinHandle` which lets you cancel or pause the future.

## Spawning Tokio Tasks

Sometimes, you might want to spawn a background task that needs multiple threads or talk to hardware that might block your app code. In these cases, we can directly spawn a Tokio task from our future. For Dioxus-Desktop, your task will be spawned onto Tokio's Multithreaded runtime:

````rs@spawn.rs
cx.spawn(async {
    let _ = tokio::spawn(async {}).await;

    let _ = tokio::task::spawn_local(async {
        // some !Send work
    })
    .await;
});
````
# Best Practices

## Reusable Components

As much as possible, break your code down into small, reusable components and hooks, instead of implementing large chunks of the UI in a single component. This will help you keep the code maintainable – it is much easier to e.g. add, remove or re-order parts of the UI if it is organized in components.

Organize your components in modules to keep the codebase easy to navigate!

## Minimize State Dependencies

While it is possible to share state between components, this should only be done when necessary. Any component that is associated with a particular state object needs to be re-rendered when that state changes. For this reason:

* Keep state local to a component if possible
* When sharing state through props, only pass down the specific data necessary
# Error handling

A selling point of Rust for web development is the reliability of always knowing where errors can occur and being forced to handle them

However, we haven't talked about error handling at all in this guide! In this chapter, we'll cover some strategies in handling errors to ensure your app never crashes.

## The simplest – returning None

Astute observers might have noticed that `Element` is actually a type alias for `Option<VNode>`. You don't need to know what a `VNode` is, but it's important to recognize that we could actually return nothing at all:

````rust
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    None
}
````

This lets us add in some syntactic sugar for operations we think *shouldn't* fail, but we're still not confident enough to "unwrap" on.

 > 
 > The nature of `Option<VNode>` might change in the future as the `try` trait gets upgraded.

````rust
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    // immediately return "None"
    let name = cx.use_hook(|_| Some("hi"))?;
}
````

## Early return on result

Because Rust can't accept both Options and Results with the existing try infrastructure, you'll need to manually handle Results. This can be done by converting them into Options or by explicitly handling them.

````rust
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    // Convert Result to Option
    let name = cx.use_hook(|_| "1.234").parse().ok()?;


    // Early return
    let count = cx.use_hook(|_| "1.234");
    let val = match count.parse() {
        Ok(val) => val
        Err(err) => return cx.render(rsx!{ "Parsing failed" })
    };
}
````

Notice that while hooks in Dioxus do not like being called in conditionals or loops, they *are* okay with early returns. Returning an error state early is a completely valid way of handling errors.

## Match results

The next "best" way of handling errors in Dioxus is to match on the error locally. This is the most robust way of handling errors, though it doesn't scale to architectures beyond a single component.

To do this, we simply have an error state built into our component:

````rust
let err = use_state(cx, || None);
````

Whenever we perform an action that generates an error, we'll set that error state. We can then match on the error in a number of ways (early return, return Element, etc).

````rust
fn Commandline(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let error = use_state(cx, || None);

    cx.render(match *error {
        Some(error) => rsx!(
            h1 { "An error occured" }
        )
        None => rsx!(
            input {
                oninput: move |_| error.set(Some("bad thing happened!")),
            }
        )
    })
}
````

## Passing error states through components

If you're dealing with a handful of components with minimal nesting, you can just pass the error handle into child components.

````rust
fn Commandline(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let error = use_state(cx, || None);

    if let Some(error) = **error {
        return cx.render(rsx!{ "An error occured" });
    }

    cx.render(rsx!{
        Child { error: error.clone() }
        Child { error: error.clone() }
        Child { error: error.clone() }
        Child { error: error.clone() }
    })
}
````

Much like before, our child components can manually set the error during their own actions. The advantage to this pattern is that we can easily isolate error states to a few components at a time, making our app more predictable and robust.

## Going global

A strategy for handling cascaded errors in larger apps is through signaling an error using global state. This particular pattern involves creating an "error" context, and then setting it wherever relevant. This particular method is not as "sophisticated" as React's error boundary, but it is more fitting for Rust.

To get started, consider using a built-in hook like `use_context` and `use_context_provider` or Fermi. Of course, it's pretty easy to roll your own hook too.

At the "top" of our architecture, we're going to want to explicitly declare a value that could be an error.

````rust
enum InputError {
    None,
    TooLong,
    TooShort,
}

static INPUT_ERROR: Atom<InputError> = |_| InputError::None;
````

Then, in our top level component, we want to explicitly handle the possible error state for this part of the tree.

````rust
fn TopLevel(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let error = use_read(cx, INPUT_ERROR);

    match error {
        TooLong => return cx.render(rsx!{ "FAILED: Too long!" }),
        TooShort => return cx.render(rsx!{ "FAILED: Too Short!" }),
        _ => {}
    }
}
````

Now, whenever a downstream component has an error in its actions, it can simply just set its own error state:

````rust
fn Commandline(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let set_error = use_set(cx, INPUT_ERROR);

    cx.render(rsx!{
        input {
            oninput: move |evt| {
                if evt.value.len() > 20 {
                    set_error(InputError::TooLong);
                }
            }
        }
    })
}
````

This approach to error handling is best in apps that have "well defined" error states. Consider using a crate like `thiserror` or `anyhow` to simplify the generation of the error types.

This pattern is widely popular in many contexts and is particularly helpful whenever your code generates a non-recoverable error. You can gracefully capture these "global" error states without panicking or mucking up state.
# Antipatterns

This example shows what not to do and provides a reason why a given pattern is considered an "AntiPattern". Most anti-patterns are considered wrong for performance or code re-usability reasons.

## Unnecessarily Nested Fragments

Fragments don't mount a physical element to the DOM immediately, so Dioxus must recurse into its children to find a physical DOM node. This process is called "normalization". This means that deeply nested fragments make Dioxus perform unnecessary work. Prefer one or two levels of fragments / nested components until presenting a true DOM element.

Only Component and Fragment nodes are susceptible to this issue. Dioxus mitigates this with components by providing an API for registering shared state without the Context Provider pattern.

````rs@anti_patterns.rs
// ❌ Don't unnecessarily nest fragments
let _ = cx.render(rsx!(
    Fragment {
        Fragment {
            Fragment {
                Fragment {
                    Fragment {
                        div { "Finally have a real node!" }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
));

// ✅ Render shallow structures
cx.render(rsx!(
    div { "Finally have a real node!" }
))
````

## Incorrect Iterator Keys

As described in the [dynamic rendering chapter](../interactivity/dynamic_rendering.md#the-key-attribute), list items must have unique keys that are associated with the same items across renders. This helps Dioxus associate state with the contained components and ensures good diffing performance. Do not omit keys, unless you know that the list will never change.

````rs@anti_patterns.rs
let data: &HashMap<_, _> = &cx.props.data;

// ❌ No keys
cx.render(rsx! {
    ul {
        data.values().map(|value| rsx!(
            li { "List item: {value}" }
        ))
    }
});

// ❌ Using index as keys
cx.render(rsx! {
    ul {
        cx.props.data.values().enumerate().map(|(index, value)| rsx!(
            li { key: "{index}", "List item: {value}" }
        ))
    }
});

// ✅ Using unique IDs as keys:
cx.render(rsx! {
    ul {
        cx.props.data.iter().map(|(key, value)| rsx!(
            li { key: "{key}", "List item: {value}" }
        ))
    }
})
````

## Avoid Interior Mutability in Props

While it is technically acceptable to have a `Mutex` or a `RwLock` in the props, they will be difficult to use.

Suppose you have a struct `User` containing the field `username: String`. If you pass a `Mutex<User>` prop to a `UserComponent` component, that component may wish to pass the username as a `&str` prop to a child component. However, it cannot pass that borrowed field down, since it only would live as long as the `Mutex`'s lock, which belongs to the `UserComponent` function. Therefore, the component will be forced to clone the `username` field.

## Avoid Updating State During Render

Every time you update the state, Dioxus needs to re-render the component – this is inefficient! Consider refactoring your code to avoid this.

Also, if you unconditionally update the state during render, it will be re-rendered in an infinite loop.
# Publishing
# Publishing

Congrats! You've made your first Dioxus app that actually does some pretty cool stuff. This app uses your operating system's WebView library, so it's portable to be distributed for other platforms.

In this section, we'll cover how to bundle your app for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Install `cargo-bundle`

The first thing we'll do is install [`cargo-bundle`](https://github.com/burtonageo/cargo-bundle). This extension to cargo will make it very easy to package our app for the various platforms.

According to the `cargo-bundle` github page,

*"cargo-bundle is a tool used to generate installers or app bundles for GUI  executables built with cargo. It can create .app bundles for Mac OS X and iOS, .deb packages for Linux, and .msi installers for Windows (note however that iOS and Windows support is still experimental). Support for creating .rpm packages (for Linux) and .apk packages (for Android) is still pending."*

To install, simply run

`cargo install cargo-bundle`

## Setting up your project

To get a project setup for bundling, we need to add some flags to our `Cargo.toml` file.

````toml
[package]
name = "example"
# ...other fields...

[package.metadata.bundle]
name = "DogSearch"
identifier = "com.dogs.dogsearch"
version = "1.0.0"
copyright = "Copyright (c) Jane Doe 2016. All rights reserved."
category = "Developer Tool"
short_description = "Easily search for Dog photos"
long_description = """
This app makes it quick and easy to browse photos of dogs from over 200 bree
"""
````

## Building

Following cargo-bundle's instructions, we simply `cargo-bundle --release` to produce a final app with all the optimizations and assets builtin.

Once you've ran `cargo-bundle --release`, your app should be accessible in

`target/release/bundle/<platform>/`.

For example, a macOS app would look like this:

![Published App](/assets/static/publish.png)

Nice! And it's only 4.8 Mb – extremely lean!! Because Dioxus leverages your platform's native WebView, Dioxus apps are extremely memory efficient and won't waste your battery.

 > 
 > Note: not all CSS works the same on all platforms. Make sure to view your app's CSS on each platform – or web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari) before publishing.
## Publishing with Github Pages

To build our app and publish it to Github:

* Make sure GitHub Pages is set up for your repo
* Build your app with `trunk build --release` (include `--public-url <repo-name>` to update asset prefixes if using a project site)
* Move your generated HTML/CSS/JS/Wasm from `dist` into the folder configured for Github Pages
* Add and commit with git
* Push to GitHub
# Custom Renderer

Dioxus is an incredibly portable framework for UI development. The lessons, knowledge, hooks, and components you acquire over time can always be used for future projects. However, sometimes those projects cannot leverage a supported renderer or you need to implement your own better renderer.

Great news: the design of the renderer is entirely up to you! We provide suggestions and inspiration with the 1st party renderers, but only really require processing `DomEdits` and sending `UserEvents`.

## The specifics:

Implementing the renderer is fairly straightforward. The renderer needs to:

1. Handle the stream of edits generated by updates to the virtual DOM
1. Register listeners and pass events into the virtual DOM's event system

Essentially, your renderer needs to process edits and generate events to update the VirtualDOM. From there, you'll have everything needed to render the VirtualDOM to the screen.

Internally, Dioxus handles the tree relationship, diffing, memory management, and the event system, leaving as little as possible required for renderers to implement themselves.

For reference, check out the [javascript interpreter](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/interpreter) or [tui renderer](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/tui) as a starting point for your custom renderer.

## Templates

Dioxus is built around the concept of [Templates](https://docs.rs/dioxus-core/latest/dioxus_core/prelude/struct.Template.html). Templates describe a UI tree known at compile time with dynamic parts filled at runtime. This is useful internally to make skip diffing static nodes, but it is also useful for the renderer to reuse parts of the UI tree. This can be useful for things like a list of items. Each item could contain some static parts and some dynamic parts. The renderer can use the template to create a static part of the UI once, clone it for each element in the list, and then fill in the dynamic parts.

## Mutations

The `Mutation` type is a serialized enum that represents an operation that should be applied to update the UI. The variants roughly follow this set:

````rust
enum Mutation {
    AppendChildren,
    AssignId,
    CreatePlaceholder,
    CreateTextNode,
    HydrateText,
    LoadTemplate,
    ReplaceWith,
    ReplacePlaceholder,
    InsertAfter,
    InsertBefore,
    SetAttribute,
    SetText,
    NewEventListener,
    RemoveEventListener,
    Remove,
    PushRoot,
}
````

The Dioxus diffing mechanism operates as a [stack machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine) where the "push_root" method pushes a new "real" DOM node onto the stack and "append_child" and "replace_with" both remove nodes from the stack.

### An Example

For the sake of understanding, let's consider this example – a very simple UI declaration:

````rust
rsx!( h1 {"count {x}"} )
````

To get things started, Dioxus must first navigate to the container of this h1 tag. To "navigate" here, the internal diffing algorithm generates the DomEdit `PushRoot` where the ID of the root is the container.

When the renderer receives this instruction, it pushes the actual Node onto its own stack. The real renderer's stack will look like this:

````rust
instructions: [
    PushRoot(Container)
]
stack: [
    ContainerNode,
]
````

Next, Dioxus will encounter the h1 node. The diff algorithm decides that this node needs to be created, so Dioxus will generate the DomEdit `CreateElement`. When the renderer receives this instruction, it will create an unmounted node and push it into its own stack:

````rust
instructions: [
    PushRoot(Container),
    CreateElement(h1),
]
stack: [
    ContainerNode,
    h1,
]
````

Next, Dioxus sees the text node, and generates the `CreateTextNode` DomEdit:

````rust
instructions: [
    PushRoot(Container),
    CreateElement(h1),
    CreateTextNode("hello world")
]
stack: [
    ContainerNode,
    h1,
    "hello world"
]
````

Remember, the text node is not attached to anything (it is unmounted) so Dioxus needs to generate an Edit that connects the text node to the h1 element. It depends on the situation, but in this case, we use `AppendChildren`. This pops the text node off the stack, leaving the h1 element as the next element in line.

````rust
instructions: [
    PushRoot(Container),
    CreateElement(h1),
    CreateTextNode("hello world"),
    AppendChildren(1)
]
stack: [
    ContainerNode,
    h1
]
````

We call `AppendChildren` again, popping off the h1 node and attaching it to the parent:

````rust
instructions: [
    PushRoot(Container),
    CreateElement(h1),
    CreateTextNode("hello world"),
    AppendChildren(1),
    AppendChildren(1)
]
stack: [
    ContainerNode,
]
````

Finally, the container is popped since we don't need it anymore.

````rust
instructions: [
    PushRoot(Container),
    CreateElement(h1),
    CreateTextNode("hello world"),
    AppendChildren(1),
    AppendChildren(1),
    PopRoot
]
stack: []
````

Over time, our stack looked like this:

````rust
[]
[Container]
[Container, h1]
[Container, h1, "hello world"]
[Container, h1]
[Container]
[]
````

Notice how our stack is empty once UI has been mounted. Conveniently, this approach completely separates the Virtual DOM and the Real DOM. Additionally, these edits are serializable, meaning we can even manage UIs across a network connection. This little stack machine and serialized edits make Dioxus independent of platform specifics.

Dioxus is also really fast. Because Dioxus splits the diff and patch phase, it's able to make all the edits to the RealDOM in a very short amount of time (less than a single frame) making rendering very snappy. It also allows Dioxus to cancel large diffing operations if higher priority work comes in while it's diffing.

It's important to note that there *is* one layer of connectedness between Dioxus and the renderer. Dioxus saves and loads elements (the PushRoot edit) with an ID. Inside the VirtualDOM, this is just tracked as a u64.

Whenever a `CreateElement` edit is generated during diffing, Dioxus increments its node counter and assigns that new element its current NodeCount. The RealDom is responsible for remembering this ID and pushing the correct node when PushRoot(ID) is generated. Dioxus reclaims the IDs of elements when removed. To stay in sync with Dioxus you can use a sparse Vec (Vec\<Option<T>\>) with possibly unoccupied items. You can use the ids as indexes into the Vec for elements, and grow the Vec when an id does not exist.

This little demo serves to show exactly how a Renderer would need to process an edit stream to build UIs. A set of serialized DomEditss for various demos is available for you to test your custom renderer against.

## Event loop

Like most GUIs, Dioxus relies on an event loop to progress the VirtualDOM. The VirtualDOM itself can produce events as well, so it's important that your custom renderer can handle those too.

The code for the WebSys implementation is straightforward, so we'll add it here to demonstrate how simple an event loop is:

````rust
pub async fn run(&mut self) -> dioxus_core::error::Result<()> {
    // Push the body element onto the WebsysDom's stack machine
    let mut websys_dom = crate::new::WebsysDom::new(prepare_websys_dom());
    websys_dom.stack.push(root_node);

    // Rebuild or hydrate the virtualdom
    let mutations = self.internal_dom.rebuild();
    websys_dom.apply_mutations(mutations);

    // Wait for updates from the real dom and progress the virtual dom
    loop {
        let user_input_future = websys_dom.wait_for_event();
        let internal_event_future = self.internal_dom.wait_for_work();

        match select(user_input_future, internal_event_future).await {
            Either::Left((_, _)) => {
                let mutations = self.internal_dom.work_with_deadline(|| false);
                websys_dom.apply_mutations(mutations);
            },
            Either::Right((event, _)) => websys_dom.handle_event(event),
        }

        // render
    }
}
````

It's important that you decode the real events from your event system into Dioxus' synthetic event system (synthetic meaning abstracted). This simply means matching your event type and creating a Dioxus `UserEvent` type. Right now, the VirtualEvent system is modeled almost entirely around the HTML spec, but we are interested in slimming it down.

````rust
fn virtual_event_from_websys_event(event: &web_sys::Event) -> VirtualEvent {
    match event.type_().as_str() {
        "keydown" => {
            let event: web_sys::KeyboardEvent = event.clone().dyn_into().unwrap();
            UserEvent::KeyboardEvent(UserEvent {
                scope_id: None,
                priority: EventPriority::Medium,
                name: "keydown",
                // This should be whatever element is focused
                element: Some(ElementId(0)),
                data: Arc::new(KeyboardData{
                    char_code: event.char_code(),
                    key: event.key(),
                    key_code: event.key_code(),
                    alt_key: event.alt_key(),
                    ctrl_key: event.ctrl_key(),
                    meta_key: event.meta_key(),
                    shift_key: event.shift_key(),
                    location: event.location(),
                    repeat: event.repeat(),
                    which: event.which(),
                })
            })
        }
        _ => todo!()
    }
}
````

## Custom raw elements

If you need to go as far as relying on custom elements for your renderer – you totally can. This still enables you to use Dioxus' reactive nature, component system, shared state, and other features, but will ultimately generate different nodes. All attributes and listeners for the HTML and SVG namespace are shuttled through helper structs that essentially compile away (pose no runtime overhead). You can drop in your own elements any time you want, with little hassle. However, you must be absolutely sure your renderer can handle the new type, or it will crash and burn.

These custom elements are defined as unit structs with trait implementations.

For example, the `div` element is (approximately!) defined as such:

````rust
struct div;
impl div {
    /// Some glorious documentation about the class property.
    const TAG_NAME: &'static str = "div";
    const NAME_SPACE: Option<&'static str> = None;
    // define the class attribute
    pub fn class<'a>(&self, cx: NodeFactory<'a>, val: Arguments) -> Attribute<'a> {
        cx.attr("class", val, None, false)
    }
    // more attributes
}
````

You've probably noticed that many elements in the `rsx!` macros support on-hover documentation. The approach we take to custom elements means that the unit struct is created immediately where the element is used in the macro. When the macro is expanded, the doc comments still apply to the unit struct, giving tons of in-editor feedback, even inside a proc macro.

# Native Core

If you are creating a renderer in rust, native-core provides some utilities to implement a renderer. It provides an abstraction over DomEdits and handles the layout for you.

## RealDom

The `RealDom` is a higher-level abstraction over updating the Dom. It updates with `DomEdits` and provides a way to incrementally update the state of nodes based on what attributes change.

### Example

Let's build a toy renderer with borders, size, and text color.
Before we start let's take a look at an example element we can render:

````rust
cx.render(rsx!{
    div{
        color: "red",
        p{
            border: "1px solid black",
            "hello world"
        }
    }
})
````

In this tree, the color depends on the parent's color. The size depends on the children's size, the current text, and the text size. The border depends on only the current node.

In the following diagram arrows represent dataflow:

To help in building a Dom, native-core provides four traits: State, ChildDepState, ParentDepState, NodeDepState, and a RealDom struct. The ChildDepState, ParentDepState, and NodeDepState provide a way to describe how some information in a node relates to that of its relatives. By providing how to build a single node from its relations, native-core will derive a way to update the state of all nodes for you with `#[derive(State)]`. Once you have a state you can provide it as a generic to RealDom. RealDom provides all of the methods to interact and update your new dom.

Now that we have our state, we can put it to use in our dom. Re can update the dom with update_state to update the structure of the dom (adding, removing, and changing properties of nodes) and then apply_mutations to update the ToyState for each of the nodes that changed.

````rust
fn main(){
    fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
        cx.render(rsx!{
            div{
                color: "red",
                "hello world"
            }
        })
    }
    let vdom = VirtualDom::new(app);
    let rdom: RealDom<ToyState> = RealDom::new();

    let mutations = dom.rebuild();
    // update the structure of the real_dom tree
    let to_update = rdom.apply_mutations(vec![mutations]);
    let mut ctx = AnyMap::new();
    // set the font size to 3.3
    ctx.insert(3.3f32);
    // update the ToyState for nodes in the real_dom tree
    let _to_rerender = rdom.update_state(&dom, to_update, ctx).unwrap();

    // we need to run the vdom in a async runtime
    tokio::runtime::Builder::new_current_thread()
        .enable_all()
        .build()?
        .block_on(async {
            loop{
                let wait = vdom.wait_for_work();
                let mutations = vdom.work_with_deadline(|| false);
                let to_update = rdom.apply_mutations(mutations);
                let mut ctx = AnyMap::new();
                ctx.insert(3.3);
                let _to_rerender = rdom.update_state(vdom, to_update, ctx).unwrap();

                // render...
            }
        })
}

## Layout

For most platforms, the layout of the Elements will stay the same. The layout_attributes module provides a way to apply HTML attributes to a stretch layout style.

## Conclusion

That should be it! You should have nearly all the knowledge required on how to implement your own renderer. We're super interested in seeing Dioxus apps brought to custom desktop renderers, mobile renderers, video game UI, and even augmented reality! If you're interested in contributing to any of these projects, don't be afraid to reach out or join the [community](https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM).
# Roadmap & Feature-set

This feature set and roadmap can help you decide if what Dioxus can do today works for you.

If a feature that you need doesn't exist or you want to contribute to projects on the roadmap, feel free to get involved by [joining the discord](https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM).

Generally, here's the status of each platform:

* **Web**: Dioxus is a great choice for pure web-apps – especially for CRUD/complex apps. However, it does lack the ecosystem of React, so you might be missing a component library or some useful hook.

* **SSR**: Dioxus is a great choice for pre-rendering, hydration, and rendering HTML on a web endpoint. Be warned – the VirtualDom is not (currently) `Send + Sync`.

* **Desktop**: You can build very competent single-window desktop apps right now. However, multi-window apps require support from Dioxus core and are not ready.

* **Mobile**: Mobile support is very young. You'll be figuring things out as you go and there are not many support crates for peripherals.

* **LiveView**: LiveView support is very young. You'll be figuring things out as you go. Thankfully, none of it is too hard and any work can be upstreamed into Dioxus.

## Work in Progress

### Build Tool

We are currently working on our own build tool called [Dioxus CLI](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/cli) which will support:

* an interactive TUI
* on-the-fly reconfiguration
* hot CSS reloading
* two-way data binding between browser and source code
* an interpreter for `rsx!`
* ability to publish to github/netlify/vercel
* bundling for iOS/Desktop/etc

### Server Component Support

While not currently fully implemented, the expectation is that LiveView apps can be a hybrid between Wasm and server-rendered where only portions of a page are "live" and the rest of the page is either server-rendered, statically generated, or handled by the host SPA.

### Native rendering

We are currently working on a native renderer for Dioxus using WGPU called [Blitz](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz/). This will allow you to build apps that are rendered natively for iOS, Android, and Desktop.
# Contributing

Development happens in the [Dioxus GitHub repository](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus). If you've found a bug or have an idea for a feature, please submit an issue (but first check if someone hasn't [done it already](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues)).

[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/discussions) can be used as a place to ask for help or talk about features. You can also join [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM) where some development discussion happens.

## Improving Docs

If you'd like to improve the docs, PRs are welcome! Both Rust docs ([source](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages)) and this guide ([source](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/docs/guide)) can be found in the GitHub repo.

## Working on the Ecosystem

Part of what makes React great is the rich ecosystem. We'd like the same for Dioxus! So if you have a library in mind that you'd like to write and many people would benefit from, it will be appreciated. You can [browse npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:react-component) for inspiration.

## Bugs & Features

If you've fixed [an open issue](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues), feel free to submit a PR! You can also take a look at [the roadmap](./roadmap.md) and work on something in there. Consider [reaching out](https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM) to the team first to make sure everyone's on the same page, and you don't do useless work!

All pull requests (including those made by a team member) must be approved by at least one other team member.
Larger, more nuanced decisions about design, architecture, breaking changes, trade-offs, etc. are made by team consensus.
