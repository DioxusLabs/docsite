# Describing the UI

Dioxus is a *declarative* framework. This means that instead of telling Dioxus what to do (e.g. to "create an element" or "set the color to red") we simply *declare* what we want the UI to look like using RSX.

````rs@hello_world_desktop.rs
// define a component that renders a div with the text "Hello, world!"
fn App() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        div { "Hello, world!" }
    }
}
````

Here, we use the `rsx!` macro to *declare* that we want a `div` element, containing the text `"Hello, world!"`. Dioxus takes the RSX and constructs a user interface from it.

## Editing RSX with Hot-Reloading

When using `dx serve`, your app's RSX is automatically hot-reloaded whenever you edit and save the file. You can edit RSX structure, add new elements, and style your markup without a full rebuild.

Whenever you edit *Rust* code, then `dx` will automatically force a "full rebuild" of your app.

As of Dioxus 0.7, you can run `dx serve --hotpatch` to enable hot-reloading of Rust code at runtime.

For an in-depth guide in what can and can't be hot-reloaded, check the [hot-reload guide](../essentials/ui/hotreload.md).

## RSX is just HTML

Dioxus provides the `rsx! {}` macro for assembling `Element`s in your app. The `rsx! {}` macro primarily speaks HTML: the web, desktop, and mobile Dioxus first-party renderers all use HTML and CSS as the layout and styling technologies.

This means you can reuse your knowledge of the web and build your app using `div`, `span`, `img`, `style`, `button`, and more.

The RSX syntax is a "strict" form of Rust that uses Rust's `Struct` syntax for assembling elements:

````rs@guide_rsx.rs
rsx! {
    div {
        class: "bg-red-100"
    }
}
````

Elements in RSX differ slightly from Rust struct syntax: they can also contain child structs placed immediately after the final attribute.

````rs@guide_rsx.rs
rsx! {
    div { class: "bg-red-100",
        button {
            onclick: move |_| info!("Clicked"),
            "Click me!"
        }
    }
}
````

Additionally, all quoted strings in RSX imply `format!()` automatically, so you can define a variable outside your markup and use it in your strings without an explicit format call:

````rs@guide_rsx.rs
rsx! {
    div { "Breed: {breed}" }
}
````

Any expression that can be rendered to a String can be included directly in RSX. RSX also accepts `Option<Element>` and iterators of Elements:

````rs@guide_rsx.rs
rsx! {
    // Anything that's `Display`
    {"Something"}

    // Optionals
    {show_title.then(|| rsx! { "title!" } )}

    // And iterators
    ul {
        {(0..5).map(|i| rsx! { "{i}" })}
    }
}
````

Dioxus provides two items of syntax sugar for these common cases: `for` loops and `if` chains. These blocks return the contained RSX directly.

````rs@guide_rsx.rs
rsx! {
    if show_title {
        "title!"
    }

    ul {
        for item in 0..5 {
            "{item}"
        }
    }
}
````

For lists, Dioxus uses the `key` attribute to ensure it's comparing the right elements between renders. If you forget to add a `key` attribute to your list item, you might run into performance and state management issues. Usually you can find a unique key to differentiate your list items:

````rs@guide_rsx.rs
rsx! {
    for user in users {
        div {
            key: "{user.id}",
            "{user.name}"
        }
    }
}
````

## Adding UI to our *HotDog* App

Let's add a basic UI to our app. We'll add a header, a body image for the dog photo, and some basic buttons.

````rs@guide_rsx.rs
#[component]
fn App() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        div { id: "title",
            h1 { "HotDog! ðŸŒ­" }
        }
        div { id: "dogview",
            img { src: "https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/pitbull/dog-3981540_1280.jpg" }
        }
        div { id: "buttons",
            button { id: "skip", "skip" }
            button { id: "save", "save!" }
        }
    }
}
````

Our app is coming together!
