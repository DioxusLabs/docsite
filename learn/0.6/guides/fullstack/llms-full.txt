# Hydration

In dioxus fullstack, the server renders the initial HTML for improved loading times. This initial version of the page is what most web crawlers and search engines see. After the initial HTML is rendered, the client makes the page interactive and takes over rendering in a process called **hydration**. Most of the time, you shouldn't need to think about hydration, but there are a few things you need to keep in mind to avoid [hydration errors](#hydration-errors). To better understand hydration, let's walk through a simple example:

````rs@hydration.rs
fn Weather() -> Element {
    let mut weather = use_server_future(fetch_weather)?;

    rsx! {
        div {
            "{weather:?}"
        }
        button {
            onclick: move |_| weather.restart(),
            "Refetch"
        }
    }
}
````

## Rendering the initial HTML

When the server receives a request to render the `Weather` component, it renders the page to HTML and serializes some additional data the client needs to hydrate the page. It will follow these steps to render our component:

1. Run the component
1. Wait until all server futures are resolved
1. Serialize any non-deterministic data (like the `weather` future) for the client
1. Render the HTML

Once the server finishes rendering, it will send this structure to the client as HTML:

## Hydrating on the client

When the client receives the initial HTML, it hydrates the HTML by rerunning each component and linking each node that component renders to the node the server rendered. Rerunning each component lets the client re-construct some non-serializable state like event handlers and kick off any client side logic like `use_effect` and `use_future`.

It will follow these steps:

1. Deserialize any non-deterministic data from the server (like the `weather` future)
1. Run the component with the deserialized data. All server futures are immediately resolved with the deserialized data from the server.
1. Hydrate the HTML sent from the server. This adds all event handlers and links the html nodes to the component so they can be moved or modified later

## Hydration errors

For hydration to work, **the component must render exactly the same thing on the client and the server**. If it doesn't, you might see an error like this:

````
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'textContent')
at RawInterpreter.run (yourwasm-hash.js:1:12246)
````

Or this:

````
Error deserializing data:
Semantic(None, "invalid type: floating point `1.2`, expected integer")
This type was serialized on the server at src/main.rs:11:5 with the type name f64. The client failed to deserialize the type i32 at /path/to/server_future.rs
````

### Non-deterministic data with server cached

You must put any non-deterministic data in `use_server_future`, `use_server_cached` or `use_effect` to avoid hydration errors. For example, if you need to render a random number on your page, you can use `use_server_cached` to cache the random number on the server and then use it on the client:

````rs@hydration.rs
// ❌ The random number will be different on the client and the server
let random: u8 = use_hook(|| rand::random());
// ✅ The same random number will be serialized on the server and deserialized on the client
let random: u8 = use_server_cached(|| rand::random());
````

### Async loading with server futures

If you need render some data from a server future, you need to use `use_server_future` to serialize the data instead of waiting for the (non-deterministic) amount of time `use_resource(...).suspend()?` takes:

````rs@hydration.rs
// ❌ The server function result may be finished on the server, but pending on the client
let random: u8 = use_resource(|| random_server_function()).suspend()?().unwrap_or_default();
// ✅ Once the server function is resolved on the server, it will be sent to the client
let random: u8 = use_server_future(|| random_server_function())?()
    .unwrap()
    .unwrap_or_default();
````

### Client only data with effects

If you need to grab some data that is only available on the client, make sure you get it inside of a `use_effect` hook which runs after the component has been hydrated:

````rs@hydration.rs
// ❌ Using a different value client side before hydration will cause hydration issues
// because the server rendered the html with another value
let mut storage = use_signal(|| {
    #[cfg(feature = "server")]
    return None;
    let window = web_sys::window().unwrap();
    let local_storage = window.local_storage().unwrap().unwrap();
    local_storage.set_item("count", "1").unwrap();
    local_storage.get_item("count").unwrap()
});

// ✅ Changing the value inside of an effect is fine because effects run after hydration
let mut storage = use_signal(|| None);
use_effect(move || {
    let window = web_sys::window().unwrap();
    let local_storage = window.local_storage().unwrap().unwrap();
    local_storage.set_item("count", "1").unwrap();
    storage.set(local_storage.get_item("count").unwrap());
});
````

### Avoid side effects in server cached hooks

The dioxus fullstack specific hooks `use_server_cached` and `use_server_future` don't run the same on the server and the client. The server will always run the closure, but the client may not run the closure if the server serialized the result. Because of this, the code you run inside these hooks **cannot have side effects**. If it does, the side effects will not be serialized and it can cause a hydration mismatch error:

````rs@hydration.rs
// ❌ The state of the signal cannot be serialized on the server
let mut storage = use_signal(|| None);
use_server_future(move || async move {
    storage.set(Some(server_future().await));
})?;

// ✅ The value returned from use_server_future will be serialized on the server and hydrated on the client
let storage = use_server_future(|| async move { server_future().await })?;
````
# Managing Fullstack Dependencies

Fullstack applications build to at least two different binaries:

* The client application that runs the desktop, mobile, or web application
* The server that renders the initial HTML and runs server functions

Those binaries tend to have different dependencies and those dependencies often are only compatible with a specific target platform. This guide will cover how fullstack manages each binary's dependencies and how to add dependencies that are only compatible with one binary/target.

## Client and Server Feature Flags

Dioxus uses feature flags to differentiate between the different binaries a single library can produce. Each target binary should have a feature flag in your `Cargo.toml` file that enables the corresponding feature in dioxus. For example, if you are targeting `web` and `desktop` with a fullstack server, you would add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

````toml
[dependencies]
# Don't include any renderer features in your dioxus dependency directly. They will be added in feature flags.
# The fullstack feature enables the bindings between the server and client without enabling a specific binary target.
dioxus = { version = "0.6", features = ["fullstack"] }

[features]
# The web feature enables the web renderer. Dioxus will automatically enable the feature you define that activates `dioxus/web` when building the client WASM bundle.
web = ["dioxus/web"]
# The desktop feature enables the desktop renderer. Dioxus will automatically enable the feature you define that activates `dioxus/desktop` when building the client native bundle.
desktop = ["dioxus/desktop"]
# The server feature enables server functions and server-side rendering. Dioxus will automatically enable the feature you define that activates `dioxus/server` when building the server binary.
server = ["dioxus/server"]
````

Feature flags like these for the client and server are automatically generated by the CLI when you run `dx new` with fullstack enabled. If you are creating a project from scratch, you will need to add the feature flags manually.

 > 
 > If you are not familiar with features in rust, you can read more about feature flags in the [cargo reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html).

## Adding Server Only Dependencies

Many dependencies like [`tokio`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/index.html) and [`axum`](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/index.html) are only compatible with the server. If these dependencies are enabled when building a WASM bundle for the browser client, you will get a compilation error. For example, if we want to interact with the filesystem in a server function, we might want to add `tokio`. `tokio` has utilities for working with async IO like [`tokio::fs::File`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/fs/struct.File.html). Let's try it as a dependency to our fullstack project:

````toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ❌ If tokio is added as a required dependency, it will be included in both the server
# and the web bundle. The web bundle will fail to build because tokio is not
# compatible with wasm
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
````

If we try to compile with tokio as a required dependency, we will get a compilation error like this:

````shell
error[E0432]: unresolved import `crate::sys::IoSourceState`
  --> /Users/user/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/mio-1.0.2/src   |source.rs:14:5
14 | use crate::sys::IoSourceState;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no `IoSourceState` in `sys`
...
````

Since we added `tokio` as a dependency for all three binaries, cargo tries to compile it for each target. This fails because `tokio` is not compatible with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

To fix the issue, we can **make the dependency optional and only enable it in the server feature**:

````toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ✅ Since the tokio dependency is optional, it is not included in the web and desktop
# bundles.
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"], optional = true }

[features]
# ...
# ✅ Since the tokio dependency is enabled in the server feature, it is included in
# the server binary.
server = ["dioxus/server", "dep:tokio"]
````

Now when we build with `dx serve`, the project compiles successfully.

## Adding Client Only Dependencies

Many dependencies like [`wasm-bindgen`](https://docs.rs/wasm-bindgen/latest/wasm_bindgen/index.html) and [`web-sys`](https://docs.rs/web-sys/latest/web_sys/index.html) are only compatible with the client. Unlike server-only dependencies, these dependencies can generally compile on native targets, but they will panic when used outside of the browser.

You can cut down on build times for your server and native binaries by only including web dependencies in the browser client binary.

Instead of adding web only dependencies every binary in your project like this:

````toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ❌ If web-sys is added as a required dependency, it will be included in the server,
# native, and the web bundle which makes build times longer.
web-sys = { version = "0.3.60", features = ["console"] }
````

You can make the dependency optional and only enable it in the `web` feature in your `Cargo.toml`:

````toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ✅ Since the web-sys dependency is optional, it is not included in the server and
# native bundles.
web-sys = { version = "0.3.60", features = ["console"], optional = true }

[features]
# ...
# ✅ Since the web-sys dependency is enabled in the web feature, it is included in
# the web bundle.
web = ["dioxus/web", "dep:web-sys"]
````

## Managing Binary Specific Imports

Once you have set up binary specific dependencies, you need to adjust any of your imports to only import the dependencies when building for the binary that includes those dependencies.

For example, if `tokio` is only enabled in the server feature, you will need to import it like this:

````rs@server_tokio_import.rs
// Since the tokio dependency is only enabled in the server feature,
// we need to only import it when the server feature is enabled.
#[cfg(feature = "server")]
use tokio::fs::File;
#[cfg(feature = "server")]
use tokio::io::AsyncReadExt;
````

You also need to only compile any usage of the dependency when the feature is enabled:

````rs@server_tokio_import.rs
// Since the tokio dependency is only enabled in the server feature,
// we need to only compile any usage of the dependency when the server feature is enabled.
#[cfg(feature = "server")]
async fn read_file() -> Result<String, std::io::Error> {
    let mut file = File::open("path/to/file").await?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents).await?;
    Ok(contents)
}

// The bodies of server functions automatically only compile when the server feature is enabled.
#[server]
async fn get_file_contents() -> Result<String, ServerFnError> {
    let mut file = File::open("path/to/file").await?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents).await?;
    Ok(contents)
}
````

It may be more convenient to group server or client specific code into a module that is only compiled when the feature is enabled:

````rs@server_tokio_import.rs
// Instead of configuring each item that is only used in the server, you can group
// them into a module that is only compiled when the server feature is enabled.
#[cfg(feature = "server")]
mod tokio_utilities {
    use std::path::PathBuf;
    use tokio::fs::File;
    use tokio::io::AsyncReadExt;

    pub async fn read_file(path: PathBuf) -> Result<String, std::io::Error> {
        let mut file = File::open(path).await?;
        let mut contents = String::new();
        file.read_to_string(&mut contents).await?;
        Ok(contents)
    }
}

// Then you can define your server functions using shared utilities you defined for
// server only code.
#[server]
async fn get_file_contents() -> Result<String, ServerFnError> {
    let file = tokio_utilities::read_file(PathBuf::from("path/to/file")).await?;
    Ok(file)
}

#[server]
async fn get_other_file_contents() -> Result<String, ServerFnError> {
    let file = tokio_utilities::read_file(PathBuf::from("path/to/other/file")).await?;
    Ok(file)
}
````

# Communicating with the server

`dioxus-fullstack` provides server functions that allow you to call an automatically generated API on the server from the client as if it were a local function.

To make a server function, simply add the `#[server(YourUniqueType)]` attribute to a function. The function must:

* Be an async function
* Have arguments and a return type that both implement serialize and deserialize (with [serde](https://serde.rs/)).
* Return a `Result` with an error type of ServerFnError

 > 
 > If you are targeting WASM on the server with WASI, you must call `register` on the type you passed into the server macro in your main function before starting your server to tell Dioxus about the server function. For all other targets, the server function will be registered automatically.

Let's continue building on the app we made in the [getting started](../../getting_started/index.md) guide. We will add a server function to our app that allows us to double the count on the server.

First, add serde as a dependency:

````shell
cargo add serde
````

Next, add the server function to your `main.rs`:

````rs@server_function.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case)]

use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    launch(App)
}

fn App() -> Element {
    let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);

    rsx! {
        h1 { "High-Five counter: {count}" }
        button { onclick: move |_| count += 1, "Up high!" }
        button { onclick: move |_| count -= 1, "Down low!" }
        button {
            onclick: move |_| {
                async move {
                    if let Ok(new_count) = double_server(count()).await {
                        count.set(new_count);
                    }
                }
            },
            "Double"
        }
    }
}

#[server]
async fn double_server(number: i32) -> Result<i32, ServerFnError> {
    // Perform some expensive computation or access a database on the server
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
    let result = number * 2;
    println!("server calculated {result}");
    Ok(result)
}

````

Now, build your client-side bundle with `dx build --features web` and run your server with `cargo run --features ssr`. You should see a new button that multiplies the count by 2.

## Cached data fetching

One common use case for server functions is fetching data from the server:

````rs@server_data_fetch.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case, unused)]

use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    launch(app)
}

fn app() -> Element {
    let mut count = use_resource(get_server_data);

    rsx! { "server data is {count.value():?}" }
}

#[server]
async fn get_server_data() -> Result<String, ServerFnError> {
    // Access a database
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    Ok("Hello from the server!".to_string())
}

````

If you navigate to the site above, you will first see `server data is None`, then after the `WASM` has loaded and the request to the server has finished, you will see `server data is Some(Ok("Hello from the server!"))`.

This approach works, but it can be slow. Instead of waiting for the client to load and send a request to the server, what if we could get all of the data we needed for the page on the server and send it down to the client with the initial HTML page?

This is exactly what the `use_server_future` hook allows us to do! `use_server_future` is similar to the `use_resource` hook, but it allows you to wait for a future on the server and send the result of the future down to the client.

Let's change our data fetching to use `use_server_future`:

````rs@server_data_prefetch.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case, unused)]

use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    launch(app);
}

fn app() -> Element {
    let mut count = use_server_future(get_server_data)?;

    rsx! {"server data is {count.value():?}"}
}

#[server]
async fn get_server_data() -> Result<String, ServerFnError> {
    // Access a database
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    Ok("Hello from the server!".to_string())
}

````

 > 
 > Notice the `?` after `use_server_future`. This is what tells Dioxus fullstack to wait for the future to resolve before continuing rendering. If you want to not wait for a specific future, you can just remove the ? and deal with the `Option` manually.

Now when you load the page, you should see `server data is Ok("Hello from the server!")`. No need to wait for the `WASM` to load or wait for the request to finish!

````inject-dioxus
SandBoxFrame {
	url: "https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/dioxus-fullstack-server-future-qwpp4p?file=/src/main.rs:3,24"
}
````

## Running the client with dioxus-desktop

The project presented so far makes a web browser interact with the server, but it is also possible to make a desktop program interact with the server in a similar fashion. (The full example code is available in the [Dioxus repo](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/main/packages/fullstack/examples/axum-desktop))

First, we need to make two binary targets, one for the desktop program (the `client.rs` file), one for the server (the `server.rs` file). The client app and the server functions are written in a shared `lib.rs` file.

The desktop and server targets have slightly different build configuration to enable additional dependencies or features.
The Cargo.toml in the full example has more information, but the main points are:

* the client.rs has to be run with the `desktop` feature, so that the optional `dioxus-desktop` dependency is included
* the server.rs has to be run with the `ssr` features; this will generate the server part of the server functions and will run our backend server.

Once you create your project, you can run the server executable with:

````bash
cargo run --bin server --features ssr
````

and the client desktop executable with:

````bash
cargo run --bin client --features desktop
````

### Client code

The client file is pretty straightforward. You only need to set the server url in the client code, so it knows where to send the network requests. Then, dioxus_desktop launches the app.

For development, the example project runs the server on `localhost:8080`. **Before you release remember to update the url to your production url.**

### Server code

In the server code, first you have to set the network address and port where the server will listen to.

````rs@server_function_desktop_client.rs
let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:3000")
    .await
    .unwrap();
println!("listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000");
````

Then, you have to register the types declared in the server function macros into the server.
For example, consider this server function:

````rs@server_function_desktop_client.rs
#[server(GetServerData)]
async fn get_server_data() -> Result<String, ServerFnError> {
    Ok("Hello from the server!".to_string())
}
````

Finally, the server is started and it begins responding to requests.
# Extractors

Server functions are an ergonomic way to call a function on the server. Server function work by registering an endpoint on the server and using requests on the client. Most of the time, you shouldn't need to worry about how server functions operate, but there are some times when you need to get some value from the request other than the data passed in the server function.

For example, requests contain information about the user's browser (called the [user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent)). We can use an extractor to retrieve that information.

You can use the `extract` method within a server function to extract something from the request. You can extract any type that implements `FromServerContext` (or when axum is enabled, you can use axum extractors directly):

````rs@server_function_extract.rs
#[server]
pub async fn log_headers() -> Result<(), ServerFnError> {
    let headers: http::HeaderMap = extract().await?;
    log::info!("{:?}", headers[http::header::USER_AGENT]);
    Ok(())
}
````
# Middleware

Extractors allow you to wrap your server function in some code that changes either the request or the response. Dioxus fullstack integrates with [Tower](https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/index.html) to allow you to wrap your server functions in middleware.

You can use the `#[middleware]` attribute to add a layer of middleware to your server function. Let's add a timeout middleware to a server function. This middleware will stop running the server function if it reaches a certain timeout:

# Authentication

You can use [extractors](./extractors) to integrate auth with your Fullstack application.

You can create a custom extractors that extracts the auth session from the request. From that auth session, you can check if the user has the required privileges before returning the private data.

A [full auth example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/v0.6/examples/fullstack-auth) with the complete implementation is available in the fullstack examples.
# Routing

You can easily integrate your fullstack application with a client side router using Dioxus Router. This allows you to create different scenes in your app and navigate between them. You can read more about the router in the [router reference](../../router/index.md)

# Static Site Generation

Static site generation (SSG) lets you pre-generate all static pages of your application at build time. Once you have the static html pages, you can deploy them to any static hosting provider like GitHub Pages.

## Setting up the ServeConfig

SSG builds on top of the incremental rendering feature of Dioxus fullstack. We need to set up the `ServeConfig` to enable incremental rendering. The incremental config needs to render to the `public` directory where Dioxus places all other public files like the wasm binary and static assets. The `public` directory in the web folder will always be placed alongside the server binary.

````rs@static_site_generation.rs
fn main() {
    dioxus::LaunchBuilder::new()
        // Set the server config only if we are building the server target
        .with_cfg(server_only! {
            ServeConfig::builder()
                // Enable incremental rendering
                .incremental(
                    IncrementalRendererConfig::new()
                        // Store static files in the public directory where other static assets like wasm are stored
                        .static_dir(
                            std::env::current_exe()
                                .unwrap()
                                .parent()
                                .unwrap()
                                .join("public")
                        )
                        // Don't clear the public folder on every build. The public folder has other files including the wasm
                        // binary and static assets required for the app to run
                        .clear_cache(false)
                )
                .enable_out_of_order_streaming()
        })
        .launch(app);
}
````

## Configuring static routes

Once you have incremental rendering enabled, you need to tell the CLI about the static routes in your app. The CLI looks for a server function at the endpoint `"static_routes"` that returns a list of all static urls. It will call this server function at build time and pre-render all of the routes in the list.

````rs@static_site_generation.rs
#[derive(Routable, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum Route {
    // Any routes with no dynamic segments in your router will be included in the static routes list
    #[route("/")]
    Index {},
    #[route("/other")]
    Other {},
}

// The server function at the endpoint "static_routes" will be called by the CLI to generate the list of static
// routes. You must explicitly set the endpoint to `"static_routes"` in the server function attribute instead of
// the default randomly generated endpoint.
#[server(endpoint = "static_routes", output = server_fn::codec::Json)]
async fn static_routes() -> Result<Vec<String>, ServerFnError> {
    // The `Routable` trait has a `static_routes` method that returns all static routes in the enum
    Ok(Route::static_routes().iter().map(ToString::to_string).collect())
}
````

## Publishing static sites

Finally, you can bundle your site with `dx bundle --platform web --ssg`. Once the CLI finishes bundling, you should see a `public` folder in the dx folder of your project:

![Dioxus SSG](/assets/06_docs/ssg_folder.png)

The folder contains all of the static assets that you need to serve your site. You can copy the public folder into any static hosting provider like GitHub Pages.
# Axum integration

Dioxus fullstack is built on top of Axum under the hood. The launch function will set up a default Axum server for your fullstack project, but if you need more control you can drop down to a custom axum server. This guide will show you how to set up an Axum server with your Dioxus fullstack project.

## Adding axum to your project

First, we need to add axum and tokio as dependencies. Since we only need these dependencies on the server, we need to make them optional and enable them in the server feature flag. More information about server only dependencies can be found in the [dependencies guide](./managing_dependencies.md#adding-server-only-dependencies):

````toml
[dependencies]
dioxus = { version = "0.6.0", features = ["fullstack"] }
# Axum is optional because we only use it on the server
axum = { version = "0.7", optional = true }
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"], optional = true }

[features]
# ...
web = ["dioxus/web"]
# The server feature enables the axum dependency
server = ["dioxus/server", "dep:axum", "dep:tokio"]
````

## Splitting up the main function

Next we to split up our main function into two parts: one that will start dioxus on the client with the launch function, and one that will serve our Axum router. We can use `#[cfg]` attribute to control what code compiles when the web feature or server feature is enabled:

````rs@axum_integration.rs
fn main() {
    #[cfg(feature = "web")]
    // Hydrate the application on the client
    dioxus::launch(App);

    // Launch axum on the server
    #[cfg(feature = "server")]
    {
        tokio::runtime::Runtime::new()
            .unwrap()
            .block_on(async move {
                launch_server(App).await;
            });
    }
}
````

## Starting the axum server

Now we can setup our axum server in the launch_server function. Since this code should only compile when the server is enabled, we need to gate it behind a `#[cfg(feature = "server")]` attribute again.

When we serve our app the CLI will try to proxy the backend under a random port. The proxy adds devtool endpoints for hot reloading and logging to make it easier to develop your app. We need to look for the port the CLI gives us in dev mode with `server_ip` and `server_port`. If we don't find a port from the CLI, we can serve at our own ip and port for production.

Finally, when building our Axum server, we need to call `serve_dioxus_application` on the router to add all the routes Dioxus needs to serve your app.

````rs@axum_integration.rs
#[cfg(feature = "server")]
async fn launch_server(component: fn() -> Element) {
    use std::net::{IpAddr, Ipv4Addr, SocketAddr};

    // Get the address the server should run on. If the CLI is running, the CLI proxies fullstack into the main address
    // and we use the generated address the CLI gives us
    let ip =
        dioxus::cli_config::server_ip().unwrap_or_else(|| IpAddr::V4(Ipv4Addr::new(127, 0, 0, 1)));
    let port = dioxus::cli_config::server_port().unwrap_or(8080);
    let address = SocketAddr::new(ip, port);
    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind(address).await.unwrap();
    let router = axum::Router::new()
        // serve_dioxus_application adds routes to server side render the application, serve static assets, and register server functions
        .serve_dioxus_application(ServeConfigBuilder::default(), App)
        .into_make_service();
    axum::serve(listener, router).await.unwrap();
}
````

## Running your application

Now we can run our application with the CLI. The CLI will automatically detect the server feature (that enables `dioxus/server`) and the client feature (which enables `dioxus/web`, `dioxus/desktop` or `dioxus/mobile`) and build once for each platform. To run the application, we can use the following command:

````bash
dx serve
````

## Conclusion

This guide showed you how to set up a custom Axum server with your Dioxus fullstack project. You can now use all of the features of Axum in your Dioxus app, including middleware, routing, and more. If you need even more granular control over your router, you can split up the `serve_dioxus_application` function into [`serve_static_assets`](https://docs.rs/dioxus-fullstack/0.6.3/dioxus_fullstack/server/trait.DioxusRouterExt.html#tymethod.serve_static_assets), [`register_server_functions`](https://docs.rs/dioxus-fullstack/0.6.3/dioxus_fullstack/server/trait.DioxusRouterExt.html#method.register_server_functions), and [`render_handler`](https://docs.rs/dioxus-fullstack/0.6.3/dioxus_fullstack/server/fn.render_handler.html). See the documentation on each method for more details

If you want to learn more about Axum, check out the [Axum documentation](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/). Axum is built on top of the tower ecosystem which means you can use any tower service with your Axum server. The [tower-http](https://docs.rs/tower-http/latest/tower_http/) crate contains many useful utilities for your server like logging, compression, and file serving.
