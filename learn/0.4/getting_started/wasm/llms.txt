# Web

Build single-page applications that run in the browser with Dioxus. To run on the Web, your app must be compiled to WebAssembly and depend on the `dioxus` and `dioxus-web` crates.

A build of Dioxus for the web will be roughly equivalent to the size of a React build (70kb vs 65kb) but it will load significantly faster because [WebAssembly can be compiled as it is streamed](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/).

Examples:

* [TodoMVC](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/tree/master/todomvc)
* [ECommerce](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/tree/master/ecommerce-site)

 > 
 > Note: Because of the limitations of Wasm, [not every crate will work](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/reference/which-crates-work-with-wasm.html) with your web apps, so you'll need to make sure that your crates work without native system calls (timers, IO, etc).

## Support

The Web is the best-supported target platform for Dioxus.

* Because your app will be compiled to WASM you have access to browser APIs through [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/introduction.html).
* Dioxus provides hydration to resume apps that are rendered on the server. See the [fullstack](fullstack.md) getting started guide for more information.

## Tooling

To develop your Dioxus app for the web, you'll need a tool to build and serve your assets. We recommend using [dioxus-cli](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/cli) which includes a build system, Wasm optimization, a dev server, and support hot reloading:

````shell
cargo install dioxus-cli
````

Make sure the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target for rust is installed:

````shell
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
````

## Creating a Project

Create a new crate:

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd demo
````

Add Dioxus and the web renderer as dependencies (this will edit your `Cargo.toml`):

````bash
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-web
````

Edit your `main.rs`:

````rs@hello_world_web.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
// import the prelude to get access to the `rsx!` macro and the `Scope` and `Element` types
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // launch the web app
    dioxus_web::launch(App);
}

// create a component that renders a div with the text "Hello, world!"
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}

````

And to serve our app:

````bash
dx serve
````

If you open the browser and navigate to `127.0.0.1` you should see an app that looks like this:

````inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
    hello_world::HelloWorldCounter {}
}
````

## Hot Reload

1. Hot reloading allows much faster iteration times inside of rsx calls by interpreting them and streaming the edits.
1. It is useful when changing the styling/layout of a program, but will not help with changing the logic of a program.

For the web renderer, you can use the dioxus cli to serve your application with hot reloading enabled.

### Setup

Install [dioxus-cli](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/cli).

### Usage

1. Run:

````bash
dx serve --hot-reload
````

2. Change some code within a rsx or render macro
2. Open your localhost in a browser
2. Save and watch the style change without recompiling

### Limitations

1. The interpreter can only use expressions that existed on the last full recompile. If you introduce a new variable or expression to the rsx call, it will require a full recompile to capture the expression.
1. Components, Iterators, and some attributes can contain arbitrary rust code and will trigger a full recompile when changed.
