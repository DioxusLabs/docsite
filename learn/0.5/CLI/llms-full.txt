# Create a Project

Once you have the Dioxus CLI installed, you can use it to create your own project!

## Initializing a project

First, run the `dx new` command to create a new project.

 > 
 > It clones this [template](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus-template), which is used to create dioxus apps.
 > 
 > You can create your project from a different template by passing the `template` argument:
 > 
 > ````
 > dx new --template gh:dioxuslabs/dioxus-template
 > ````

Next, navigate into your new project using `cd project-name`, or simply opening it in an IDE.

 > 
 > Make sure the WASM target is installed before running the projects.
 > You can install the WASM target for rust using rustup:
 > 
 > ````
 > rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
 > ````

Finally, serve your project with `dx serve`! The CLI will tell you the address it is serving on, along with additional
info such as code warnings.
# Configure Project

This chapter will teach you how to configure the CLI with the `Dioxus.toml` file. There's an [example](#config-example) which has comments to describe individual keys. You can copy that or view this documentation for a more complete learning experience.

"ðŸ”’" indicates a mandatory item. Some headers are mandatory, but none of the keys inside them are. In that case, you only need to include the header, but no keys. It might look weird, but it's normal.

## Structure

Each header has its TOML form directly under it.

### Application ðŸ”’

````toml
[application]
````

Application-wide configuration. Applies to both web and desktop.

* **name** ðŸ”’ - Project name & title.
  ````toml
  name = "my_project"
  ````

* **default_platform** ðŸ”’ - The platform this project targets
  ````toml
  # Currently supported platforms: web, desktop
  default_platform = "web"
  ````

* **out_dir** - The directory to place the build artifacts from `dx build` or `dx serve` into. This is also where the `assets` directory will be copied into.
  ````toml
  out_dir = "dist"
  ````

* **asset_dir** - The directory with your static assets. The CLI will automatically copy these assets into the **out_dir** after a build/serve.
  ````toml
  asset_dir = "public"
  ````

* **sub_package** - The sub package in the workspace to build by default.
  ````toml
  sub_package = "my-crate"
  ````

### Web.App ðŸ”’

````toml
[web.app]
````

Web-specific configuration.

* **title** - The title of the web page.
  ````toml
  # HTML title tag content
  title = "project_name"
  ````

* **base_path** - The base path to build the application for serving at. This can be useful when serving your application in a subdirectory under a domain. For example, when building a site to be served on GitHub Pages.
  ````toml
  # The application will be served at domain.com/my_application/, so we need to modify the base_path to the path where the application will be served
  base_path = "my_application"
  ````

### Web.Watcher ðŸ”’

````toml
[web.watcher]
````

Development server configuration.

* **reload_html** - If this is true, the cli will rebuild the index.html file every time the application is rebuilt
  
  ````toml
  reload_html = true
  ````

* **watch_path** - The files & directories to monitor for changes
  
  ````toml
  watch_path = ["src", "public"]
  ````

* **index_on_404** - If enabled, Dioxus will serve the root page when a route is not found.
  *This is needed when serving an application that uses the router*. However, when serving your app using something else than Dioxus (e.g. GitHub Pages), you will have to check how to configure it on that platform. In GitHub Pages, you can make a copy of `index.html` named `404.html` in the same directory.
  
  ````toml
  index_on_404 = true
  ````

### Web.Resource ðŸ”’

````toml
[web.resource]
````

Static resource configuration.

* **style** - CSS files to include in your application.
  
  ````toml
  style = [
     # Include from public_dir.
     "./assets/style.css",
     # Or some asset from online cdn.
     "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"
  ]
  ````

* **script** - JavaScript files to include in your application.
  
  ````toml
  script = [
      # Include from asset_dir.
      "./public/index.js",
      # Or from an online CDN.
      "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"
  ]
  ````

### Web.Resource.Dev ðŸ”’

````toml
[web.resource.dev]
````

This is the same as [`[web.resource]`](#webresource-), but it only works in development servers. For example, if you want to include a file in a `dx serve` server, but not a `dx serve --release` server, put it here.

### Web.Proxy

````toml
[[web.proxy]]
````

Configuration related to any proxies your application requires during development. Proxies will forward requests to a new service.

* **backend** - The URL to the server to proxy. The CLI will forward any requests under the backend relative route to the backend instead of returning 404
  ````toml
  backend = "http://localhost:8000/api/"
  ````
  
  This will cause any requests made to the dev server with prefix /api/ to be redirected to the backend server at http://localhost:8000. The path and query parameters will be passed on as-is (path rewriting is currently not supported).

## Config example

This includes all fields, mandatory or not.

````toml
[application]

# App name
name = "project_name"

# The Dioxus platform to default to
default_platform = "web"

# `build` & `serve` output path
out_dir = "dist"

# The static resource path
asset_dir = "public"

[web.app]

# HTML title tag content
title = "project_name"

[web.watcher]

# When watcher is triggered, regenerate the `index.html`
reload_html = true

# Which files or dirs will be monitored
watch_path = ["src", "public"]

# Include style or script assets
[web.resource]

# CSS style file
style = []

# Javascript code file
script = []

[web.resource.dev]

# Same as [web.resource], but for development servers

# CSS style file
style = []

# JavaScript files
script = []

[[web.proxy]]
backend = "http://localhost:8000/api/"
````
# Translating existing HTML

Dioxus uses a custom format called RSX to represent the HTML because it is more concise and looks more like Rust code. However, it can be a pain to convert existing HTML to RSX. That's why Dioxus comes with a tool called `dx translate` that can automatically convert HTML to RSX!

Dx translate can make converting large chunks of HTML to RSX much easier! Lets try translating some of the HTML from the Dioxus homepage:

````sh
dx translate --raw  "<div class=\"relative w-full mx-4 sm:mx-auto text-gray-600\"><div class=\"text-[3em] md:text-[5em] font-semibold dark:text-white text-ghdarkmetal font-sans py-12 flex flex-col\"><span>Fullstack, crossplatform,</span><span>lightning fast, fully typed.</span></div><h3 class=\"text-[2em] dark:text-white font-extralight text-ghdarkmetal pt-4 max-w-screen-md mx-auto\">Dioxus is a Rust library for building apps that run on desktop, web, mobile, and more.</h3><div class=\"pt-12 text-white text-[1.2em] font-sans font-bold flex flex-row justify-center space-x-4\"><a href=\"/learn/0.5/getting_started\" dioxus-prevent-default=\"onclick\" class=\"bg-red-600 py-2 px-8 hover:-translate-y-2 transition-transform duration-300\" data-dioxus-id=\"216\">Quickstart</a><a href=\"/learn/0.5/reference\" dioxus-prevent-default=\"onclick\" class=\"bg-blue-500 py-2 px-8 hover:-translate-y-2 transition-transform duration-300\" data-dioxus-id=\"214\">Read the docs</a></div><div class=\"max-w-screen-2xl mx-auto pt-36\"><h1 class=\"text-md\">Trusted by top companies</h1><div class=\"pt-4 flex flex-row flex-wrap justify-center\"><div class=\"h-12 w-40 bg-black p-2 m-4 flex justify-center items-center\"><img src=\"static/futurewei_bw.png\"></div><div class=\"h-12 w-40 bg-black p-2 m-4 flex justify-center items-center\"><img src=\"static/airbuslogo.svg\"></div><div class=\"h-12 w-40 bg-black p-2 m-4 flex justify-center items-center\"><img src=\"static/ESA_logo.svg\"></div><div class=\"h-12 w-40 bg-black p-2 m-4 flex justify-center items-center\"><img src=\"static/yclogo.svg\"></div><div class=\"h-12 w-40 bg-black p-2 m-4 flex justify-center items-center\"><img src=\"static/satellite.webp\"></div></div></div></div>"
````

We get the following RSX you can easily copy and paste into your code:

````rs
div { class: "relative w-full mx-4 sm:mx-auto text-gray-600",
   div { class: "text-[3em] md:text-[5em] font-semibold dark:text-white text-ghdarkmetal font-sans py-12 flex flex-col",
      span { "Fullstack, crossplatform," }
      span { "lightning fast, fully typed." }
   }
   h3 { class: "text-[2em] dark:text-white font-extralight text-ghdarkmetal pt-4 max-w-screen-md mx-auto",
      "Dioxus is a Rust library for building apps that run on desktop, web, mobile, and more."
   }
   div { class: "pt-12 text-white text-[1.2em] font-sans font-bold flex flex-row justify-center space-x-4",
      a {
         href: "/learn/0.5/getting_started",
         data_dioxus_id: "216",
         dioxus_prevent_default: "onclick",
         class: "bg-red-600 py-2 px-8 hover:-translate-y-2 transition-transform duration-300",
         "Quickstart"
      }
      a {
         dioxus_prevent_default: "onclick",
         href: "/learn/0.5/reference",
         data_dioxus_id: "214",
         class: "bg-blue-500 py-2 px-8 hover:-translate-y-2 transition-transform duration-300",
         "Read the docs"
      }
   }
   div { class: "max-w-screen-2xl mx-auto pt-36",
      h1 { class: "text-md", "Trusted by top companies" }
      div { class: "pt-4 flex flex-row flex-wrap justify-center",
         div { class: "h-12 w-40 p-2 m-4 flex justify-center items-center",
            img { src: "static/futurewei_bw.png" }
         }
         div { class: "h-12 w-40 p-2 m-4 flex justify-center items-center",
            img { src: "static/airbuslogo.svg" }
         }
         div { class: "h-12 w-40 p-2 m-4 flex justify-center items-center",
            img { src: "static/ESA_logo.svg" }
         }
         div { class: "h-12 w-40 p-2 m-4 flex justify-center items-center",
            img { src: "static/yclogo.svg" }
         }
         div { class: "h-12 w-40 p-2 m-4 flex justify-center items-center",
            img { src: "static/satellite.webp" }
         }
      }
   }
}

## Usage

The `dx translate` command has several flags you can use to control your html input and rsx output.

You can use the `--file` flag to translate an HTML file to RSX:

````sh
dx translate --file index.html
````

Or you can use the `--raw` flag to translate a string of HTML to RSX:

````sh
dx translate --raw "<div>Hello world</div>"
````

Both of those commands will output the following RSX:

````rs
div { "Hello world" }
````

The `dx translate` command will output the RSX to stdout. You can use the `--output` flag to write the RSX to a file instead.

````sh
dx translate --raw "<div>Hello world</div>" --output index.rs
````

You can automatically create a component with the `--component` flag.

````sh
dx translate --raw "<div>Hello world</div>" --component
````

This will output the following component:

````rs
fn component() -> Element {
   rsx! {
      div { "Hello world" }
   }
}
````

To learn more about the different flags `dx translate` supports, run `dx translate --help`.
