# Dioxus Tutorial

In this small book, we'll walk you through creating and deploying your first Dioxus app.

This guide will primarily focus on the higher-level concepts of Dioxus without diving too deep into the details of specific APIs. We recommend experimenting with the APIs yourself or reading the [Essential Concepts](../essentials/index.md) and specific [Guides](guides/index.md) for more information.

## What are we building?

In this tutorial, we'll be building a small app called: *"HotDog"*. This app will serve as a great way to learn about building UIs, adding state, and deploying.

The features of *HotDog* are fairly simple:

- Engage with a stream of cute dog photos
- Swipe right if we want to save the dog photo to our collection
- Swipe left if we don't want to save the dog photo
- View the dog photos we saved later

At the end of the tutorial, you'll have your very own *HotDog* app to remix and download to your device.
