# Setting Up Hot Reload

1. Hot reloading allows much faster iteration times inside of rsx calls by interpreting them and streaming the edits.
1. It is useful when changing the styling/layout of a program, but will not help with changing the logic of a program.
1. Currently the cli only implements hot reloading for the web renderer.

# Setup

Install [dioxus-cli](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/cli).
Hot reloading is automatically enabled when using the web renderer on debug builds.

# Usage

1. run:

````
dioxus serve --hot-reload
````

2. change some code within a rsx macro
2. open your localhost in a browser
2. save and watch the style change without recompiling

# Limitations

1. The interpreter can only use expressions that existed on the last full recompile. If you introduce a new variable or expression to the rsx call, it will trigger a full recompile to capture the expression.
1. Components and Iterators can contain arbitrary rust code and will trigger a full recompile when changed.
