# Defining Routes

When creating a \[`Routable`\] enum, we can define routes for our application using the `route("path")` attribute.

## Route Segments

Each route is made up of segments. Most segments are separated by `/` characters in the path.

There are four fundamental types of segments:

1. [Static segments](#static-segments) are fixed strings that must be present in the path.
1. [Dynamic segments](#dynamic-segments) are types that can be parsed from a segment.
1. [Catch-all segments](#catch-all-segments) are types that can be parsed from multiple segments.
1. [Query segments](#query-segments) are types that can be parsed from the query string.

Routes are matched:

* First, from most specific to least specific (Static then Dynamic then Catch All) (Query is always matched)
* Then, if multiple routes match the same path, the order in which they are defined in the enum is followed.

## Static segments

Fixed routes match a specific path. For example, the route `#[route("/about")]` will match the path `/about`.

````rs@static_segments.rs
#[derive(Routable, Clone)]
#[rustfmt::skip]
enum Route {
    // Routes always start with a slash
    #[route("/")]
    Home {},
    // You can have multiple segments in a route
    #[route("/hello/world")]
    HelloWorld {},
}

#[component]
fn Home() -> Element {
    todo!()
}

#[component]
fn HelloWorld() -> Element {
    todo!()
}
````

## Dynamic Segments

Dynamic segments are in the form of `:name` where `name` is
the name of the field in the route variant. If the segment is parsed
successfully then the route matches, otherwise the matching continues.

The segment can be of any type that implements `FromStr`.

````rs@dynamic_segments.rs
#[derive(Routable, Clone)]
#[rustfmt::skip]
enum Route {
    // segments that start with : are dynamic segments
    #[route("/post/:name")]
    BlogPost {
        // You must include dynamic segments in child variants
        name: String,
    },

    #[route("/document/:id")]
    Document {
        // You can use any type that implements FromStr
        // If the segment can't be parsed, the route will not match
        id: usize,
    },
}

// Components must contain the same dynamic segments as their corresponding variant
#[component]
fn BlogPost(name: String) -> Element {
    todo!()
}

#[component]
fn Document(id: usize) -> Element {
    todo!()
}
````

## Catch All Segments

Catch All segments are in the form of `:..name` where `name` is the name of the field in the route variant. If the segments are parsed successfully then the route matches, otherwise the matching continues.

The segment can be of any type that implements `FromSegments`. (`Vec<String>` implements this by default)

Catch All segments must be the *last route segment* in the path (query segments are not counted) and cannot be included in nests.

````rs@catch_all_segments.rs
#[derive(Routable, Clone)]
#[rustfmt::skip]
enum Route {
    // segments that start with :.. are catch all segments
    #[route("/blog/:..segments")]
    BlogPost {
        // You must include catch all segment in child variants
        segments: Vec<String>,
    },
}

// Components must contain the same catch all segments as their corresponding variant
#[component]
fn BlogPost(segments: Vec<String>) -> Element {
    todo!()
}
````

## Query Segments

Query segments are in the form of `?:name&:othername` where `name` and `othername` are the names of fields in the route variant.

Unlike [Dynamic Segments](#dynamic-segments) and [Catch All Segments](#catch-all-segments), parsing a Query segment must not fail.

The segment can be of any type that implements `FromQueryArgument`.

Query segments must be the *after all route segments* and cannot be included in nests.

````rs@query_segments.rs
#[derive(Routable, Clone)]
#[rustfmt::skip]
enum Route {
    // segments that start with ?: are query segments
    #[route("/blog?:name&:surname")]
    BlogPost {
        // You must include query segments in child variants
        name: String,
        surname: String,
    },
}

#[component]
fn BlogPost(name: String, surname: String) -> Element {
    rsx! {
        div { "This is your blogpost with a query segment:" }
        div { "Name: {name}" }
        div { "Surname: {surname}" }
    }
}
````
# Nested Routes

When developing bigger applications we often want to nest routes within each
other. As an example, we might want to organize a settings menu using this
pattern:

````plain
└ Settings
  ├ General Settings (displayed when opening the settings)
  ├ Change Password
  └ Privacy Settings
````

We might want to map this structure to these paths and components:

````plain
/settings		  -> Settings { GeneralSettings }
/settings/password -> Settings { PWSettings }
/settings/privacy  -> Settings { PrivacySettings }
````

Nested routes allow us to do this without repeating /settings in every route.

## Nesting

To nest routes, we use the `#[nest("path")]` and `#[end_nest]` attributes.

The path in nest must not:

1. Contain a [Catch All Segment](index.md#catch-all-segments)
1. Contain a [Query Segment](index.md#query-segments)

If you define a dynamic segment in a nest, it will be available to all child routes and layouts.

To finish a nest, we use the `#[end_nest]` attribute or the end of the enum.

````rs@nest.rs
#[derive(Routable, Clone)]
// Skipping formatting allows you to indent nests
#[rustfmt::skip]
enum Route {
    // Start the /blog nest
    #[nest("/blog")]
        // You can nest as many times as you want
        #[nest("/:id")]
            #[route("/post")]
            PostId {
                // You must include parent dynamic segments in child variants
                id: usize,
            },
        // End nests manually with #[end_nest]
        #[end_nest]
        #[route("/:id")]
        // The absolute route of BlogPost is /blog/:name
        BlogPost {
            id: usize,
        },
    // Or nests are ended automatically at the end of the enum
}

#[component]
fn BlogPost(id: usize) -> Element {
    todo!()
}

#[component]
fn PostId(id: usize) -> Element {
    todo!()
}
````
# Layouts

Layouts allow you to wrap all child routes in a component. This can be useful when creating something like a header that will be used in many different routes.

[`Outlet`] tells the router where to render content in layouts. In the following example,
the Index will be rendered within the [`Outlet`].

This page is built with Dioxus. It uses Layouts in several different places. Here is an outline of how layouts are used on the current page:

````inject-dioxus
LayoutsExplanation {}
````

Here is a more complete example of a layout wrapping the body of a page.

````rs@outlet.rs
#[derive(Routable, Clone)]
#[rustfmt::skip]
enum Route {
    #[layout(Wrapper)]
        #[route("/")]
        Index {},
}

#[component]
fn Wrapper() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        header { "header" }
        // The index route will be rendered here
        Outlet::<Route> {}
        footer { "footer" }
    }
}

#[component]
fn Index() -> Element {
    rsx! { h1 { "Index" } }
}
````

The example above will output the following HTML (line breaks added for
readability):

````html
<header>header</header>
<h1>Index</h1>
<footer>footer</footer>
````

## Layouts with dynamic segments

You can combine layouts with [nested routes](./routes/nested.md) to create dynamic layouts with content that changes based on the current route.

Just like routes, layouts components must accept a prop for each dynamic segment in the route. For example, if you have a route with a dynamic segment like `/:name`, your layout component must accept a `name` prop:

````rs@outlet.rs
#[derive(Routable, Clone)]
#[rustfmt::skip]
enum Route {
    #[nest("/:name")]
        #[layout(Wrapper)]
            #[route("/")]
            Index {
                name: String,
            },
}

#[component]
fn Wrapper(name: String) -> Element {
    rsx! {
        header { "Welcome {name}!" }
        // The index route will be rendered here
        Outlet::<Route> {}
        footer { "footer" }
    }
}

#[component]
fn Index(name: String) -> Element {
    rsx! { h1 { "This is a homepage for {name}" } }
}
````

Or to get the full route, you can use the `use_route` hook.

````rs@outlet.rs
#[derive(Routable, Clone)]
#[rustfmt::skip]
enum Route {
    #[layout(Wrapper)]
        #[route("/:name")]
        Index {
            name: String,
        },
}

#[component]
fn Wrapper() -> Element {
    let full_route = use_route::<Route>();
    rsx! {
        header { "Welcome to {full_route}!" }
        // The index route will be rendered here
        Outlet::<Route> {}
        footer { "footer" }
    }
}

#[component]
fn Index(name: String) -> Element {
    rsx! { h1 { "This is a homepage for {name}" } }
}
````
# Links & Navigation

When we split our app into pages, we need to provide our users with a way to
navigate between them. On regular web pages, we'd use an anchor element for that,
like this:

````html
<a href="/other">Link to an other page</a>
````

However, we cannot do that when using the router for three reasons:

1. Anchor tags make the browser load a new page from the server. This takes a
   lot of time, and it is much faster to let the router handle the navigation
   client-side.
1. Navigation using anchor tags only works when the app is running inside a
   browser. This means we cannot use them inside apps using Dioxus Desktop.
1. Anchor tags cannot check if the target page exists. This means we cannot
   prevent accidentally linking to non-existent pages.

To solve these problems, the router provides us with a \[`Link`\] component we can
use like this:

````rs@links.rs
#[component]
fn NavBar() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        nav {
            Link { to: Route::Home {}, "Home" }
        }
        Outlet::<Route> {}
    }
}
````

The `target` in the example above is similar to the `href` of a regular anchor
element. However, it tells the router more about what kind of navigation it
should perform. It accepts something that can be converted into a
\[`NavigationTarget`\]:

* The example uses a Internal route. This is the most common type of navigation.
  It tells the router to navigate to a page within our app by passing a variant of a \[`Routable`\] enum. This type of navigation can never fail if the link component is used inside a router component.
* \[`External`\] allows us to navigate to URLs outside of our app. This is useful
  for links to external websites. NavigationTarget::External accepts an URL to navigate to. This type of navigation can fail if the URL is invalid.

 > 
 > The \[`Link`\] accepts several props that modify its behavior. See the API docs
 > for more details.
# Programmatic Navigation

Sometimes we want our application to navigate to another page without having the
user click on a link. This is called programmatic navigation.

## Using a Navigator

We can get a navigator with the [`navigator`] function which returns a [`Navigator`].

We can use the [`Navigator`] to trigger four different kinds of navigation:

* `push` will navigate to the target. It works like a regular anchor tag.
* `replace` works like `push`, except that it replaces the current history entry
  instead of adding a new one. This means the prior page cannot be restored with the browser's back button.
* `Go back` works like the browser's back button.
* `Go forward` works like the browser's forward button.

````rs@navigator.rs
#[component]
fn Home() -> Element {
    let nav = navigator();

    // push
    nav.push(Route::PageNotFound { route: vec![] });

    // replace
    nav.replace(Route::Home {});

    // go back
    nav.go_back();

    // go forward
    nav.go_forward();

    rsx! { h1 { "Welcome to the Dioxus Blog!" } }
}
````

You might have noticed that, like [`Link`], the [`Navigator`]s `push` and
`replace` functions take a [`NavigationTarget`]. This means we can use either
`Internal`, or `External` targets.

## External Navigation Targets

Unlike a [`Link`], the [`Navigator`] cannot rely on the browser (or webview) to
handle navigation to external targets via a generated anchor element.

This means, that under certain conditions, navigation to external targets can
fail.
# History Providers

\[`HistoryProvider`\]s are used by the router to keep track of the navigation history
and update any external state (e.g. the browser's URL).

The router provides two \[`HistoryProvider`\]s, but you can also create your own.
The two default implementations are:

* The \[`MemoryHistory`\] is a custom implementation that works in memory.
* The \[`LiveviewHistory`\] is a custom implementation that works with the liveview renderer.
* The \[`WebHistory`\] integrates with the browser's URL.

By default, the router uses the \[`MemoryHistory`\]. It might be changed to use
\[`WebHistory`\] when the `web` feature is active, but that is not guaranteed.

You can override the default history:

````rs@history_provider.rs
#[component]
fn App() -> Element {
    rsx! {Router::<Route> { config: || RouterConfig::default().history(WebHistory::default()) }}
}
````
# History Buttons

Some platforms, like web browsers, provide users with an easy way to navigate
through an app's history. They have UI elements or integrate with the OS.

However, native platforms usually don't provide such amenities, which means that
apps wanting users to have access to them, need to implement them. For this
reason, the router comes with two components, which emulate a browser's back and
forward buttons:

* [`GoBackButton`]
* [`GoForwardButton`]

 > 
 > If you want to navigate through the history programmatically, take a look at
 > [`programmatic navigation`](./navigation/programmatic.md).

````rs@history_buttons.rs
fn HistoryNavigation() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        GoBackButton { "Back to the Past" }
        GoForwardButton { "Back to the Future" }
    }
}
````

As you might know, browsers usually disable the back and forward buttons if
there is no history to navigate to. The router's history buttons try to do that
too, but depending on the \[history provider\] that might not be possible.

Importantly, neither `WebHistory` supports that feature.
This is due to limitations of the browser History API.

However, in both cases, the router will just ignore button presses, if there is
no history to navigate to.

Also, when using `WebHistory`, the history buttons might
navigate a user to a history entry outside your app.
# Routing Update Callback

In some cases, we might want to run custom code when the current route changes. For this reason, the [`RouterConfig`] exposes an `on_update` field.

## How does the callback behave?

The `on_update` is called whenever the current routing information changes. It is called after the router updated its internal state, but before dependent components and hooks are updated.

If the callback returns a [`NavigationTarget`], the router will replace the current location with the specified target. It will not call the `on_update` again.

If at any point the router encounters a navigation failure, it will go to the appropriate state without calling the `on_update`. It doesn't matter if the invalid target initiated the navigation, was found as a redirect target, or was returned by the `on_update` itself.

## Code Example

````rs@routing_update.rs
#[derive(Routable, Clone, PartialEq)]
enum Route {
    #[route("/")]
    Index {},
    #[route("/home")]
    Home {},
}

#[component]
fn Home() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        p { "Home" }
    }
}

#[component]
fn Index() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        p { "Index" }
    }
}

fn app() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        Router::<Route> {
            config: || {
                RouterConfig::default()
                    .on_update(|state| {
                        (state.current() == Route::Index {})
                            .then_some(NavigationTarget::Internal(Route::Home {}))
                    })
            },
        }
    }
}
````
