things we don't talk about but we should
- io reactivity
- architecting state
- state synching / management, background tasks
- "good patterns"
- router state vs storage state
- maybe: "phases" of the virtualdom (spawn vs effect)
- preventDefault async vs sync
- reducer pattern?
- document listeners

things we should build/do
- stores
- reactive collections
- webview native
- ReadSignal doesn't work everywhere
- run effects on virtualdom via method
- effect vs layoutEffect
- preventDefault first poll is sync
- move coroutine out to sdk
- examples folder reorganize / cleanup
- dx new with template search (ie search for twitter clone, etc in tui)
- ban mutable props

fundamentals of state:
- lifecycle of components (reactivity?)
- primitives - hooks etc (signals, memo, resource)
  -
- organizing app

frontload the chapters with the shorter overview (similar to react.dev) that you can walk through without all the depth

- start practical
- get more "theory" as time goes on
- put more details at the end of chapters
