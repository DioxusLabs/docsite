# Bundling

Congratulations! You built your first fully-functional Dioxus app, completely loaded with Routing, asynchronous data-fetching, Server Functions, and a database! That's incredible for just a few minutes of work.

Let's get your app bundled for multiple platforms and then ready to deploy.

## Testing on Desktop and Mobile

So far, we've been testing our app in a simple web browser. Let's actually build and test our app for mobile platforms.

In Dioxus 0.6, `dx` finally supports `dx serve` for Android and iOS!

### Testing on iOS

To test iOS, your development environment needs to be setup to build iOS apps. This involves a few steps:

* Make sure you are developing on a device running macOS
* Install XCode
* [Download a recent iOS SDK and Emulator pack](https://developer.apple.com/ios/)
* Install the iOS Rust toolchains (`aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim`)

This is a multi-step process and requires creating an Apple Developer account. You shouldn't need to pay any fees until you want to sign your app. Signing your app is required for deploying to the Apple App Store and testing on your iOS device.

If everything is installed properly, you should be able to open the Simulator app:

````sh
open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app
````

If the Simulator app opens but no device pops up, you might need to open a specific device. Use `xcrun` to discover which devices you have installed.

````sh
xcrun simctl list
````

Identify an available device. We're going to simulate an iPhone 15 Pro Max:

````sh
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15 Pro Max"
````

Once the simulator is booted, we can run `dx serve --platform ios`.

Fantastic - our app works seamlessly with no changes.

### Testing on Android

Setting up your environment for Android development takes time, so make sure to read the [mobile tooling guide](../guides/mobile/index.md).

* Install the Android NDK and SDK
* Set JAVA_HOME, ANDROID_HOME, NDK_HOME, and fix PATH issues to use the `emulator` tool
* Install and set up an Android emulator
* Install the Android rustup targets (`aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android`)

Let's start an emulator. We can use the `emulator` command which should be in your PATH if setup properly. We're going to use our `Pixel_6_API_34` emulator, but you can use any device you've configured.

````sh
emulator -avd Pixel_6_API_34  -netdelay none -netspeed full
````

If we try to `dx serve --platform android`, we'll find that our app fails to build for Android. This is not good!

````text
12:45:39 [cargo]   Could not find directory of OpenSSL installation, and this `-sys` crate cannot
12:45:39 [cargo]   proceed without this knowledge. If OpenSSL is installed and this crate had
12:45:39 [cargo]   trouble finding it,  you can set the `OPENSSL_DIR` environment variable for the
12:45:39 [cargo]   compilation process.
12:45:39 [cargo]   Make sure you also have the development packages of openssl installed.
12:45:39 [cargo]   For example, `libssl-dev` on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` on Fedora.
12:45:39 [cargo]   If you're in a situation where you think the directory *should* be found
12:45:39 [cargo]   automatically, please open a bug at https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl
12:45:39 [cargo]   and include information about your system as well as this message.
12:45:39 [cargo]   $HOST = aarch64-apple-darwin
12:45:39 [cargo]   $TARGET = aarch64-linux-android
12:45:39 [cargo]   openssl-sys = 0.9.104
````

Currently, `rust-openssl` does not cross-compile properly for Android targets. To fix this, we need to add the `openssl` crate to our Cargo.toml and then enable its "vendored" feature. This will build OpenSSL from source instead of trying and failing to read it from the Android NDK.

We're only going to enable the vendored feature when targeting Android.

````toml
[target.'cfg(target_os = "android")'.dependencies]
openssl = { version = "0.10", features = ["vendored"] }
````

In the future, Dioxus might add OpenSSL's vendored feature implicitly to make this error go away. We're covering it here since it's important to understand that not every Rust dependency works out-of-the-box for iOS and Android. Unfortunately, the Rust ecosystem for mobile is still quite young and you'll need to know how to solve problems like these.

Let's try again!

````
dx serve --platform android
````

## Testing on Desktop

HotDog also works on macOS, Windows, and Linux! We can use `dx serve --platform desktop` to serve our app as a desktop app.

## Bundling for the web

After we're done making changes to our server and client apps, we can build bundles that are ready to distribute.

We're going to follow the same pattern as `dx serve` but with `dx bundle`. To start, let's build the web version of our app.

````sh
dx bundle --platform web
````

We should receive a series of INFO traces from the CLI as it builds, and then finally a path to the `public` folder it generates. Let's `cd` into its public directory and then check out its parent directory (cd ..) (the "web" folder).

````sh
❯ tree -L 3 --gitignore
.
├── public
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── favicon.ico
│   │   ├── header.svg
│   │   ├── main-14aa55e73f669f3e.css
│   │   ├── main.css
│   │   └── screenshot.png
│   ├── index.html
│   └── wasm
│       ├── hot_dog.js
│       ├── hot_dog.js.br
│       ├── hot_dog_bg.wasm
│       ├── hot_dog_bg.wasm.br
│       └── snippets
└── server
````

`dx` built a `public` folder containing our assets, index.html, and various JavaScript snippets. Alongside our public folder is a `server` binary. When we deploy our web assets, we'll also want to deploy the server since it provides our server functions.

We can manually run the server simply by executing it. If you're using a default `dioxus::launch` setup, then the server will read the `IP` and `PORT` environment variables to serve.

 > 
 > 📣 If you intend to serve from within a container (e.g., Docker), then you need to override the default `127.0.0.1` address with `IP=0.0.0.0` to listen for external connections.

![Serving the server](/assets/06_docs/serving_server.png)

## Bundling for Desktop and Mobile

To bundle desktop and mobile apps for deployment, we'll again use `dx bundle`. As of today, `dx bundle` only builds desktop apps for the native platform and architecture. Unfortunately, you can't build macOS apps from Windows, Linux apps from Mac, etc. We recommend using a Continuous Integration Matrix (like [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/running-variations-of-jobs-in-a-workflow)) to perform a "cross-build" of your app in multiple different containers.

When bundling installable apps, there are many distribution formats to choose from. We can specify these formats using the `--package-types` flag on `dx bundle`. Dioxus supports packaging a broad number of package types:

* macOS: `.app`, `.dmg`
* Linux: `.appimage`, `.rpm`, `.deb`
* Windows: `.msi`, `.exe`
* iOS: `.ipa`
* Android: `.apk`

You can specify package types like so:

````sh
dx bundle --platform desktop \
    --package-types "macos" \
    --package-types "dmg"
````

Note that not all package-types are compatible with each platform - eg. only `.exe` can be built when specifying `--platform desktop`.

We should see the outputs in our terminal:

````sh
18.252s  INFO Bundled app successfully!
18.252s  INFO App produced 2 outputs:
18.252s  INFO app - [/Users/jonkelley/Development/Tinkering/06-demos/hot_dog/target/dx/hot_dog/bundle/macos/bundle/macos/HotDog.app]
18.252s  INFO dmg - [/Users/jonkelley/Development/Tinkering/06-demos/hot_dog/target/dx/hot_dog/bundle/macos/bundle/dmg/HotDog_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg]
````

Generally, you can distribute desktop apps without needing an app store. However, some platforms like macOS might require you to sign and notarize your application to be considered "safe" for your users to open.

When distributing mobile apps, you *are required* to sign and notarize your apps. Currently, Dioxus doesn't provide built-in utilities for this, so you'll need to figure out signing by reading 3rd-party documentation.

Tauri provides documentation on the signing process:

* [macOS](https://tauri.app/distribute/sign/macos/)
* [iOS](https://tauri.app/distribute/sign/iOS/)
* [Android](https://tauri.app/distribute/sign/android/)
* [Windows](https://tauri.app/distribute/sign/Windows/)
* [Linux](https://tauri.app/distribute/sign/Linux/)

## Customizing your Bundle

Before you ship your app, you might want to configure how your app icon looks, what entitlements it has, and other details. Our `dx bundle` tool can help you configure your bundles in a variety of ways.

To configure our bundle, we'll use our `Dioxus.toml` and modify the bundle section.

````toml
[application]
name = "docsite"

[bundle]
identifier = "com.dioxuslabs"
publisher = "DioxusLabs"
icon = ["assets/icon.png"]
````

For a full list of options, see the [reference page on the `bundle` section](../cookbook/bundling.md).

## Automating dx bundle with JSON mode

Also added in Dioxus 0.6 is a JSON output mode for `dx`. This makes it possible to parse the output of the CLI using tools like [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) which provide stdin/stdout support for JSON parsing.

This mode is not particular friendly to humans, but does contain more information than the standard trace output.

````sh
{"timestamp":"   9.927s","level":"INFO","message":"Bundled app successfully!","target":"dx::cli::bundle"}
{"timestamp":"   9.927s","level":"INFO","message":"App produced 2 outputs:","target":"dx::cli::bundle"}
{"timestamp":"   9.927s","level":"DEBUG","message":"Bundling produced bundles: [\n    Bundle {\n        package_type: MacOsBundle,\n        bundle_paths: [\n            \"/Users/jonkelley/Development/Tinkering/06-demos/hot_dog/target/dx/hot_dog/bundle/macos/bundle/macos/HotDog.app\",\n        ],\n    },\n    Bundle {\n        package_type: Dmg,\n        bundle_paths: [\n            \"/Users/jonkelley/Development/Tinkering/06-demos/hot_dog/target/dx/hot_dog/bundle/macos/bundle/dmg/HotDog_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg\",\n        ],\n    },\n]","target":"dx::cli::bundle"}
{"timestamp":"   9.927s","level":"INFO","message":"app - [/Users/jonkelley/Development/Tinkering/06-demos/hot_dog/target/dx/hot_dog/bundle/macos/bundle/macos/HotDog.app]","target":"dx::cli::bundle"}

{"timestamp":"   9.927s","level":"DEBUG","json":"{\"BundleOutput\":{\"bundles\":[\"/Users/jonkelley/Development/Tinkering/06-demos/hot_dog/target/dx/hot_dog/bundle/macos/bundle/macos/HotDog.app\",\"/Users/jonkelley/Development/Tinkering/06-demos/hot_dog/target/dx/hot_dog/bundle/macos/bundle/dmg/HotDog_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg\"]}}","target":"dx"}
````

JSON mode works with all `dx` commands. However, it is most useful with `dx build` and `dx bundle`. The CLI always guarantees that the last emitted line is the result of the command. To collect the list of bundles from the `dx bundle` command, we can use `tail -1` and simple jq.

````sh
dx bundle --platform desktop \
    --json-output \
    --verbose \
    | tail -1 \
    | jq -r '.json | fromjson | .BundleOutput.bundles []'
````

This returns the list of bundles:

````
/Users/jonkelley/Development/Tinkering/06-demos/hot_dog/target/dx/hot_dog/bundle/macos/bundle/macos/HotDog.app
/Users/jonkelley/Development/Tinkering/06-demos/hot_dog/target/dx/hot_dog/bundle/macos/bundle/dmg/HotDog_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg
