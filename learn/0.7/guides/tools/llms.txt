<SYSTEM>This is the developer documentation for Dioxus from /learn/0.7/guides/tools/.</SYSTEM>
# Tools

Dioxus has an ecosystem of tools to help you develop and deploy your applications. This guide will help you set up, configure and use these tools.

## Installing the CLI

The CLI bundles together many different tools for dioxus development. Dioxus provides prebuilt binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux you can download with [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall):

````bash
cargo binstall dioxus-cli
````

### Manual installation

If you don't have cargo-binstall installed or we don't have a prebuilt binary for your platform, you can install the CLI with cargo install:

````bash
cargo install dioxus-cli
````

## Commands

To verify your installation and get an overview of all the commands available, run:

````sh
dx --help
````

You should see something like this:

````sh

  doctor       Diagnose installed tools and system configuration
  print        Print project information in a structured format, like cargo args, linker args, and other flags DX sets that might be useful in third-party tools
  translate    Translate a source file into Dioxus code
  fmt          Automatically format RSX
  check        Check the project for any issues
  config       Dioxus config file controls

## Table of Contents

Many chapters in this guide cover different commands in the CLI:

* [Create a project](./creating.md) provides an overview of the `dx new` and `dx init` commands to scaffold your dioxus project
* [Translate HTML](./translate.md) provides an overview of the `dx translate` command to convert HTML into rsx.

Other chapters explore different aspects of using the CLI and other tools:

* [Configure Project](./configure.md) explores how you can configure your project with the `Dioxus.toml` file the CLI reads
