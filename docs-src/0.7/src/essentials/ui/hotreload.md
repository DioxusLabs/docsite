# Dioxus Hot-Reloading Reference

The Dioxus Hot-Reload engine is incredibly powerful. When used properly, it provides the fastest development experience for building apps with Rust.

Dioxus 0.5 featured a limited form of hot-reloading, while Dioxus 0.6 drastically improved it. **Dioxus 0.7 introduces experimental Rust hot-reloading**, making it the first Rust framework to support hot-reloading of actual Rust code.

Dioxus provides three forms of hotreloading.

*Element hot-reloading:*

We provide this text guide as a resource for the details of hot-reloading. This guide has an accompanying video as well:

## RSX Hot-Reload

RSX hot-reloading is fundamental to the Dioxus development experience. It allows you to modify the structure, styling, and content of your user interface without recompiling your entire application.

RSX hot-reload enables you to instantly add, remove, or modify an elements in an `rsx!` block. The RSX parser works both at compile time, and in our devtools, letting DX sidestep recompiling your Rust code entirely.

```rust
fn App() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        // You can add, remove, or modify any elements
        div { class: "container" }
        h1 { "My App" }
        button { "Click me" }
    }
}
```

All string-based attributes support instant hot-reloading:
```rust
fn Button() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        button {
            // All of these can be hot-reloaded instantly
            class: "btn btn-primary",
            id: "my-button",
            title: "Click this button",
            style: "background: blue; color: white;",

            "Submit"
        }
    }
}
```

Hot-reload supports modifying complex formatted strings anywhere in your RSX. While you cannot instantly hot-reload the interior Rust expressions, you *can* move existing expressions between formatted strings.

```rust
fn Counter() -> Element {
    let count = use_signal(|| 0);

    rsx! {
        div {
            // We can move this `count` variable from here
            "Count: {count}"

            button {
                // ... to here, without a recompile!
                "Increment ({count})"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can hot-reload simple Rust expressions passed as component props. If the attribute value is a [Rust "literal"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/literal-expr.html) - a single "token" like a number, boolean, or string - DX will hot-reload it by re-parsing the new attribute and modifying the props.

```rust
fn App() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        MyButton {
            text: "Click me", // try changing the text
            enabled: true, // try changing true to false!
            count: 123, // or changing the number value!
        }
    }
}

#[component]
fn MyButton(text: String, enabled: bool, count: i32, color: String) -> Element {
    rsx! {
        button { disabled: !enabled, "{text} - {count}" }
    }
}
```

Hot-reloading works inside conditional blocks, loops, and component children. Note that the interior *expressions* don't support instant RSX hot-reload, but the interior elements and markup do.

```rust
fn TodoList() -> Element {
    let todos = use_signal(|| vec!["Learn Dioxus", "Build an app"]);

    rsx! {
        ul {
            // We can modify the *body*
            for (i, todo) in todos().iter().enumerate() {
                li {
                    key: "{i}",
                    class: "todo-item",
                    "{todo}"
                }
            }
        }

        // Conditional blocks bodies are hot-reloadable too
        if todos().len() > 5 {
            div { class: "warning", "You have many todos!" }
        }
    }
}
```

## What Requires a Full Rebuild (or a hot-patch!)

While RSX hot-reloading is very capable, some changes still require a full application rebuild:

- **New variables or expressions** not present in the last compilation
- **Logic changes** outside of RSX (function bodies, hooks, etc.)
- **Component signatures** (adding/removing props)
- **Import statements** and module structure
- **Complex Rust expressions** in attributes that involve function calls

When Rust hotpatching is enabled with the `--hotpatch` flag, DX will modify your app's assembly *in place* and not require a full rebuild. With hotpatching enabled, DX rarely issues full rebuilds. You can manually force a full rebuild of your app at any time by pressing the `r` key with the DX TUI open.

## Asset Hot-Reload

Asset hot-reloading allows you to modify CSS, images, and other static files without rebuilding your application. This works seamlessly with the `asset!()` macro system.

### CSS Hot-Reloading

CSS files are automatically watched and hot-reloaded when changed:

```rust
fn App() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        // Editing this stylesheet will cause instant updates in the running app
        Stylesheet { href: asset!("/assets/main.css") }
        div { class: "my-component", "Hello World!" }
    }
}
```

```css
/* In assets/main.css - changes here are instantly applied */
.my-component {
    background: blue;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;
    /* Change this to red and see instant updates! */
}
```

SCSS files are automatically re-compiled on changes and the generated CSS will be hot-reloaded.

### Image and Static Asset Hot-Reloading

Static assets like images also support hot-reloading:

```rust
fn Header() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        img { src: asset!("/assets/logo.png") }
    }
}
```

When you edit `/assets/logo.png`, the change appears instantly in your running application.

### Tailwind CSS Integration

When you `serve` your app, DX automatically downloads and starts the Tailwind CLI in the background. If a `tailwind.css` file is detected in the project root, the Tailwind watcher will watch updates to your Rust code and recompile the output `/assets/tailwind.css` file.

![Inline Tailwind](/assets/07/tailwind-inline.mp4)


You can manually customize the Tailwind input and output file locations using the `tailwind_input` and `tailwind_output` configuration fields in your project's Dioxus.toml.

## Experimental: Rust Hot-patching

**New in Dioxus 0.7**, you can enable experimental Rust code hot-reloading using the `--hotpatch` flag. This feature is revolutionary - allowing you to modify Rust logic and see changes without rebuilding.

To use Rust hot-reloading, run `dx serve --hotpatch`. The extra flag is required while hot-patching is still experimental, though we plan to make it default in the future.

```bash
# Enable experimental Rust hot-reloading
dx serve --hotpatch

# For specific platforms
dx serve --webview --hotpatch
dx serve --web --hotpatch
```

This system, named **Subsecond**, can reload many most changes to Rust code. However, there are a few limitations:

- You may add new globals at runtime, but their destructors will never be called.
- Globals are tracked across patches, but will renames are considered to be new globals.
- Changes to static initializers will not be observed.

Also, most importantly, Rust hot-patching currently only tracks the "tip" crate in your project. If you edit code in any of your dependencies - which might be *your* crate in a workspace - DX does â€¢not* register that change. While RSX hot-reloading works across a workspace, Subsecond currently does not.

Subsecond also works outside Dioxus. Many projects have already adopted the Subsecond library for th
