# Project Setup

Fullstack Dioxus apps are structured a bit differently than client-only apps. This distinction has implications on how we organize our apps, requiring more care when adding dependencies and including code.

In this chapter, we'll explore how to use feature flags and cargo targets to structure our apps for fullstack development.

> Dioxus provides a number of templates with `dx new` to automatically bootstrap new fullstack projects.

If you want to get started quickly, we suggest using one of the built-in templates and then heading on to next chapter.

## The Server/Client split

A "fullstack" application is actually composed of two distinct apps:

- The client application that runs the web, desktop, or mobile application
- The server application that renders the initial HTML and runs server functions

The client application comes in a variety of formats:

- A `public` folder with `index.html`, `main.js`, and `main.wasm`
- A macOS app bundle (`.app`)
- A Windows executable (`.exe`)
- A Linux AppImage, `.deb`, or `.rpm` file
- An iOS bundle (`.ipa`) or Android bundle (`.apk`)

On each of these platforms, we need to include different code and different dependencies. We can view the server application as just another platform for our app with its own set of dependencies. The server will have different dependencies than our client app, and thus we need to properly configure our app's `Cargo.toml` and build flags.

## How DX builds your app

Our build tool, DX, is capable of building both the client and server of your app simultaneously. If `--hotpatch` is enabled, DX will also automatically hot-reload both the client and server code in tandem.

When developing your app, you'll generally use `dx serve`. This command accepts the usual arguments you might pass to `cargo run`:

```sh
# We can customize the build's features, profile, or release mode
dx serve --features "spicy" --release

# We can specify examples, packages, and binaries
dx serve --example dogs
```

Under the hood, DX automatically detects if the target app has a server variant by checking its `Cargo.toml` for a Cargo feature called "server". In this Cargo feature, you would enable the `server` feature on Dioxus:

```toml
[features]
server = ["dioxus/server"]
```

DX will also look for specific client features (web/desktop/mobile) and enable the relevant feature depending on the target platform. DX uses the concept of "platform" to distinguish types of builds from one another.

To set a build's platform, you can use `--platform web/desktop/ios/android` or the shorthands like `--web`, `--desktop`, `--ios`, etc. When we specify a platform, DX also enables a corresponding feature in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
# enabled with `--web`
web = ["dioxus/web"]

# enabled with `--desktop`
desktop = ["dioxus/desktop"]

# enabled with `--mobile`
mobile = ["dioxus/mobile"]
```

If your `dioxus` dependency enables the `fullstack` feature, DX recgonizes this app is a fullstack app and then creates two builds, each with a separate platform:

```toml
[dependencies]
dioxus = { version = "0.7", features = ["fullstack"] }

[features]
web = ["dioxus/web"]
server = ["dioxus/server"]
```

Internally, DX splits your input command into two separate `cargo build` commands, each with a different platform.

Feature flags like these for the client and server are automatically generated by the CLI when you run `dx new` with fullstack enabled. If you are creating a project from scratch, you will need to add the feature flags manually.

> If you are not familiar with features in rust, you can read more about feature flags in the [cargo reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html).

## Customizing the Builds

A fullstack app is comprised of two separate binaries, so DX provides a way to customize each. Usually, the default `dx serve` command is sufficient, but for complex app setups that need per-target customization, you can use the `@client` and `@server` modifiers to pass target-specific cargo args to each:

```sh
dx serve \
  @client --ios --features "optimizations" \
  @server --bin server
```

This syntax makes it possible to have two separate entrypoints for our app. This can be extremely useful if you have an existing backend and would like to launch that alongside your Dioxus frontend.

By default, DX isolates your server and client builds by levaraging Cargo Profiles. Cargo profiles let us specify certain build modifiers like opt-level, debug symbols, LTO, and other optimizations.

DX will use these profiles
- `web-dev` / `web-release`: targetting the web with `--web`
- `server-dev` / `server-release`: targetting the server (implicitly, or with `--server`)
- `desktop-dev` / `desktop-release`: targetting iOS apps with `--ios`
- `ios-dev` / `ios-release`: targetting iOS apps with `--ios`
- `android-dev` / `android-release`: targetting iOS apps with `--ios`

These profiles correspond 1:1 with the "platforms" DX supports. Note that a `platform` is just a way of DX to isolate two builds from each other. You can completely customize the build, including:

- `--renderer`: swap between the various 1st-party renderers (ie `--renderer native`)
- `--bundle`: the bundle format of the build (`.app`, `.apk`, `.ipa`, etc.)
- all cargo options (`--features`, `--target`, `--profile`, `--bin`, etc.)

## Adding Server Only Dependencies

Many dependencies like [`tokio`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/index.html) cannot be compiled to WebAssembly, and thus should only be built for the server. If these dependencies are enabled when building a WASM bundle, you will receive cryptic compilation errors. As such, we need to take care not to accidentally add server-only dependencies to our client app.

For example, if we want to interact with the filesystem in a server function, we might want to add `tokio`. The `tokio` crate provides utilities for working with async IO with abstractions like [`tokio::fs::File`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/fs/struct.File.html). Unfortunately, if try to add `tokio` with its `full` feature set, we will receive a compilation error:

```toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ❌ If tokio is added as a required dependency, it will be included in both the server
# and the web bundle. The web bundle will fail to build because tokio is not
# compatible with wasm
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

If we try to compile with tokio as a required dependency, we will get a compilation error like this:

```sh
error[E0432]: unresolved import `crate::sys::IoSourceState`
  --> /Users/user/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/mio-1.0.2/src   |source.rs:14:5
14 | use crate::sys::IoSourceState;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no `IoSourceState` in `sys`
...
```

Since we added `tokio` as a dependency for all three binaries, cargo tries to compile it for each target. This fails because `tokio` is not compatible with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

To fix the issue, we can **make the dependency optional and only enable it in the server feature**:

```toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ✅ Since the tokio dependency is optional, it is not included in the web and desktop
# bundles.
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"], optional = true }

[features]
# ...
# ✅ Since the tokio dependency is enabled in the server feature, it is included in
# the server binary.
server = ["dioxus/server", "dep:tokio"]
```

Now when we build with `dx serve`, the project compiles successfully!

## Adding Client Only Dependencies

Many dependencies like [`wasm-bindgen`](https://docs.rs/wasm-bindgen/latest/wasm_bindgen/index.html) and [`web-sys`](https://docs.rs/web-sys/latest/web_sys/index.html) are only compatible with the client. Unlike server-only dependencies, these dependencies can compile on native targets, but they will panic when used outside of the browser.

You can reduce build times for your server and native binaries by including web dependencies only in the browser client binary.

Instead of adding web only dependencies to every binary in your project like this:
```toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ❌ If web-sys is added as a required dependency, it will be included in the server,
# native, and the web bundle which makes build times longer.
web-sys = { version = "0.3.60", features = ["console"] }
```

You can make the dependency optional and only enable it in the `web` feature in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ✅ Since the web-sys dependency is optional, it is not included in the server and
# native bundles.
web-sys = { version = "0.3.60", features = ["console"], optional = true }

[features]
# ...
# ✅ Since the web-sys dependency is enabled in the web feature, it is included in
# the web bundle.
web = ["dioxus/web", "dep:web-sys"]
```

## Managing Binary Specific Imports

Once you have set up binary specific dependencies, you need to adjust any of your imports to only import the dependencies when building for the binary that includes those dependencies.


For example, if `tokio` is only enabled in the server feature, you will need to import it like this:
```rust
{{#include ../docs-router/src/doc_examples/server_tokio_import.rs:tokio_import}}
```

You also need to only compile any usage of the dependency when the feature is enabled:
```rust
{{#include ../docs-router/src/doc_examples/server_tokio_import.rs:tokio_usage}}
```

It may be more convenient to group server or client specific code into a module that is only compiled when the feature is enabled:
```rust
{{#include ../docs-router/src/doc_examples/server_tokio_import.rs:tokio_module}}
```

> The [rust reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html) has more information about conditional compilation in rust.


## Separate Frontend and Backend Crates

If you so choose, you can split your frontend and backend into separate crates. This can be useful for larger projects where you have separate teams working on eacho or you have separate entrypoints for web, desktop, and mobile.

Workspace setups bring extra complexity, but they can make it much easier to share data types and functions across several different projects. For instance, you might have a single API crate with several entirely different apps.

In these cases, we might organize our workspace like so:

```
├── Cargo.toml
└── packages/
    ├── cat-app/
    │     ...
    ├── dog-app/
    │     ...
    └── pet-api/
          ...
```

If you're using Dioxus Fullstack, then you might want to import your `pet-api`'s server functions to call from your UI. In our client apps, we can then import the `pet-api` crate:

```toml
[dependencies]
pet-api = { workspace = true }
```

To launch the server, you can choose one of two options:

- 1. Start the pet-api server from the client project
- 2. Launch the pet-api crate's main binary

If your server is simple enough, then option 1 can be a decent option since it automatically integrates with `dx serve`.

However, if you choose to have a dedicated server binary, then you'll need to use the `@client` and `@server` modifiers to use a diffeent binary:

```sh
dx serve @client --bin dog-app @serer --bin pet-api
```

The built-in "Workspace" Dioxus Template can serve as a good starting point for workspace setups.
