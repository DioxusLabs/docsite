# Migration Guides

Dioxus has evolved over its lifetime. We feel quite stable with the current API, but there might be changes in the future.

To help migrate between versions, we've assembled a set of migration guides:

* [v0.4 to v0.5](to_05/index.md)
* [v0.5 to v0.6](to_06.md)
* [v0.6 to v0.7](to_07.md)
