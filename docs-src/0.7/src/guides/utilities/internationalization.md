If your application supports multiple languages, the [dioxus-i18n](https://github.com/dioxus-community/dioxus-i18n) crate contains helpers to make working with translations in your application easier.

You can find an example [here](https://github.com/dioxus-community/dioxus-i18n/blob/main/examples/dioxus-desktop.rs).
