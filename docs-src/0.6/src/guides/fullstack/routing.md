# Routing

You can easily integrate your fullstack application with a client side router using Dioxus Router. This allows you to create different scenes in your app and navigate between them. You can read more about the router in the [router reference](../router.md)

```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/server_router.rs}}
```

```inject-dioxus
SandBoxFrame {
	url: "https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/dioxus-fullstack-router-s75v5q?file=%2Fsrc%2Fmain.rs%3A7%2C1"
}
```
