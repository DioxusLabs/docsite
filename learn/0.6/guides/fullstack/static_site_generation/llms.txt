# Static Site Generation

Static site generation (SSG) lets you pre-generate all static pages of your application at build time. Once you have the static html pages, you can deploy them to any static hosting provider like GitHub Pages.

## Setting up the ServeConfig

SSG builds on top of the incremental rendering feature of Dioxus fullstack. We need to set up the `ServeConfig` to enable incremental rendering. The incremental config needs to render to the `public` directory where Dioxus places all other public files like the wasm binary and static assets. The `public` directory in the web folder will always be placed alongside the server binary.

````rs@static_site_generation.rs
fn main() {
    dioxus::LaunchBuilder::new()
        // Set the server config only if we are building the server target
        .with_cfg(server_only! {
            ServeConfig::builder()
                // Enable incremental rendering
                .incremental(
                    IncrementalRendererConfig::new()
                        // Store static files in the public directory where other static assets like wasm are stored
                        .static_dir(
                            std::env::current_exe()
                                .unwrap()
                                .parent()
                                .unwrap()
                                .join("public")
                        )
                        // Don't clear the public folder on every build. The public folder has other files including the wasm
                        // binary and static assets required for the app to run
                        .clear_cache(false)
                )
                .enable_out_of_order_streaming()
        })
        .launch(app);
}
````

## Configuring static routes

Once you have incremental rendering enabled, you need to tell the CLI about the static routes in your app. The CLI looks for a server function at the endpoint `"static_routes"` that returns a list of all static urls. It will call this server function at build time and pre-render all of the routes in the list.

````rs@static_site_generation.rs
#[derive(Routable, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum Route {
    // Any routes with no dynamic segments in your router will be included in the static routes list
    #[route("/")]
    Index {},
    #[route("/other")]
    Other {},
}

// The server function at the endpoint "static_routes" will be called by the CLI to generate the list of static
// routes. You must explicitly set the endpoint to `"static_routes"` in the server function attribute instead of
// the default randomly generated endpoint.
#[server(endpoint = "static_routes", output = server_fn::codec::Json)]
async fn static_routes() -> Result<Vec<String>, ServerFnError> {
    // The `Routable` trait has a `static_routes` method that returns all static routes in the enum
    Ok(Route::static_routes().iter().map(ToString::to_string).collect())
}
````

## Publishing static sites

Finally, you can bundle your site with `dx bundle --platform web --ssg`. Once the CLI finishes bundling, you should see a `public` folder in the dx folder of your project:

![Dioxus SSG](/assets/06_docs/ssg_folder.png)

The folder contains all of the static assets that you need to serve your site. You can copy the public folder into any static hosting provider like GitHub Pages.
