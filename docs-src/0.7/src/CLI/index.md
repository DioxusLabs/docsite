# Introduction

The ✨**Dioxus CLI**✨ is a tool to get Dioxus projects off the ground.

There's no documentation for commands here, but you can see all commands using `dx --help` once you've installed the CLI! Furthermore, you can run `dx <command> --help` to get help with a specific command.

## Features

* Build and pack a Dioxus project.
* Format `rsx` code.
* Hot Reload.
* Create a Dioxus project from a template repository.
* And more!
