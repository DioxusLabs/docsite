/// attributes, and components.

/// # A Stateful Component
///
/// Dioxus components use hooks to store state between renders. The `use_state` hooks make it easy to update state from
/// event listeners attached to elements in the component. Whenever the state is modified, the component will be re-rendered.
///
/// Thanks to Rust's ownership rules, it's impossible to misuse the `use_state` hook.

/// # Advanced Rendering
///
/// Dioxus accepts fragments, iterators, conditionals, listeners, matching, f-string interpolation and more. Anything that can
/// be coerced into an iterator of VNodes can be used in the macro bodies. By default, `rsx!` is Lazy, meaning it won't allocate
/// until "rendered" with a `render` call.
///
/// Elements are created with a dedicated memory allocator that intelligently reuses memory between renders. A component
/// at "steady-state" performs zero global allocations, making rendering extremely fast and memory efficient.

/// # Built-in error handling

/// syntax. Components that fail to render will be frozen until the next successful render.

/// is being viewed - i.e. a settings panel that can only be shown if a user is logged in.

/// # Coroutines and tasks
///

/// reset by other logic in the component. Coroutines are extremely handy for asynchronous tasks like network requests,
/// WebSockets, and multi-threading.

/// and Dioxus will wait for the future to resolve before rendering the result. Suspense makes it possible to prevent
