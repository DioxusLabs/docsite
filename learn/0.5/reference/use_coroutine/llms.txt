# Coroutines

Another tool in your async toolbox are coroutines. Coroutines are futures that can have values sent to them.

Like regular futures, code in a coroutine will run until the next `await` point before yielding. This low-level control over asynchronous tasks is quite powerful, allowing for infinitely looping tasks like WebSocket polling, background timers, and other periodic actions.

## use_coroutine

The `use_coroutine` hook allows you to create a coroutine. Most coroutines we write will be polling loops using await.

````rs@use_coroutine_reference.rs
use futures_util::StreamExt;

fn app() {
    let ws: Coroutine<()> = use_coroutine(|rx| async move {
        // Connect to some sort of service
        let mut conn = connect_to_ws_server().await;

        // Wait for data on the service
        while let Some(msg) = conn.next().await {
            // handle messages
        }
    });
}
````

For many services, a simple async loop will handle the majority of use cases.

## Yielding Values

To yield values from a coroutine, simply bring in a `Signal` handle and set the value whenever your coroutine completes its work.

The future must be `'static` – so any values captured by the task cannot carry any references to `cx`, such as a `Signal`.

You can use [to_owned](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.ToOwned.html#tymethod.to_owned) to create a clone of the hook handle which can be moved into the async closure.

````rs@use_coroutine_reference.rs
let sync_status = use_signal(|| Status::Launching);
let sync_task = use_coroutine(|rx: UnboundedReceiver<SyncAction>| {
    let mut sync_status = sync_status.to_owned();
    async move {
        loop {
            tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
            sync_status.set(Status::Working);
        }
    }
});
````

To make this a bit less verbose, Dioxus exports the `to_owned!` macro which will create a binding as shown above, which can be quite helpful when dealing with many values.

````rs@use_coroutine_reference.rs
let sync_status = use_signal(|| Status::Launching);
let load_status = use_signal(|| Status::Launching);
let sync_task = use_coroutine(|rx: UnboundedReceiver<SyncAction>| {
    async move {
        // ...
    }
});
````

## Sending Values

You might've noticed the `use_coroutine` closure takes an argument called `rx`. What is that? Well, a common pattern in complex apps is to handle a bunch of async code at once. With libraries like Redux Toolkit, managing multiple promises at once can be challenging and a common source of bugs.

With Coroutines, we can centralize our async logic. The `rx` parameter is an Channel that allows code external to the coroutine to send data *into* the coroutine. Instead of looping on an external service, we can loop on the channel itself, processing messages from within our app without needing to spawn a new future. To send data into the coroutine, we would call "send" on the handle.

````rs@use_coroutine_reference.rs
use futures_util::StreamExt;

enum ProfileUpdate {
    SetUsername(String),
    SetAge(i32),
}

let profile = use_coroutine(|mut rx: UnboundedReceiver<ProfileUpdate>| async move {
    let mut server = connect_to_server().await;

    while let Some(msg) = rx.next().await {
        match msg {
            ProfileUpdate::SetUsername(name) => server.update_username(name).await,
            ProfileUpdate::SetAge(age) => server.update_age(age).await,
        }
    }
});

rsx! {
    button { onclick: move |_| profile.send(ProfileUpdate::SetUsername("Bob".to_string())),
        "Update username"
    }
}
````

 > 
 > Note: In order to use/run the `rx.next().await` statement you will need to extend the \[`Stream`\] trait (used by \[`UnboundedReceiver`\]) by adding 'futures_util' as a dependency to your project and adding the `use futures_util::stream::StreamExt;`.

For sufficiently complex apps, we could build a bunch of different useful "services" that loop on channels to update the app.

````rs@use_coroutine_reference.rs
let profile = use_coroutine(profile_service);
let editor = use_coroutine(editor_service);
let sync = use_coroutine(sync_service);

async fn profile_service(rx: UnboundedReceiver<ProfileCommand>) {
    // do stuff
}

async fn sync_service(rx: UnboundedReceiver<SyncCommand>) {
    // do stuff
}

async fn editor_service(rx: UnboundedReceiver<EditorCommand>) {
    // do stuff
}
````

We can combine coroutines with Global State to emulate Redux Toolkit's Thunk system with much less headache. This lets us store all of our app's state *within* a task and then simply update the "view" values stored in Atoms. It cannot be understated how powerful this technique is: we get all the perks of native Rust tasks with the optimizations and ergonomics of global state. This means your *actual* state does not need to be tied up in a system like `Signal::global` or Redux – the only Atoms that need to exist are those that are used to drive the display/UI.

````rs@use_coroutine_reference.rs
static USERNAME: GlobalSignal<String> = Signal::global(|| "default".to_string());

fn app() -> Element {
    use_coroutine(sync_service);

    rsx! { Banner {} }
}

fn Banner() -> Element {
    rsx! { h1 { "Welcome back, {USERNAME}" } }
}
````

Now, in our sync service, we can structure our state however we want. We only need to update the view values when ready.

````rs@use_coroutine_reference.rs
use futures_util::StreamExt;

static USERNAME: GlobalSignal<String> = Signal::global(|| "default".to_string());
static ERRORS: GlobalSignal<Vec<String>> = Signal::global(|| Vec::new());

enum SyncAction {
    SetUsername(String),
}

async fn sync_service(mut rx: UnboundedReceiver<SyncAction>) {
    while let Some(msg) = rx.next().await {
        match msg {
            SyncAction::SetUsername(name) => {
                if set_name_on_server(&name).await.is_ok() {
                    *USERNAME.write() = name;
                } else {
                    *ERRORS.write() = vec!["Failed to set username".to_string()];
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
````

## Automatic injection into the Context API

Coroutine handles are automatically injected through the context API. You can use the `use_coroutine_handle` hook with the message type as a generic to fetch a handle.

````rs@use_coroutine_reference.rs
fn Child() -> Element {
    let sync_task = use_coroutine_handle::<SyncAction>();

    sync_task.send(SyncAction::SetUsername);

    todo!()
}

        // Wait for data on the service
