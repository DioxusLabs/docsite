# Dioxus Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll be building a small app called: *HotDog* - basically Tinder, but for dogs! This app will serve as a great way to learn about building UIs, adding state, and deploying.

By the end of this tutorial, you will launch your very own web, desktop, and mobile apps and a backend deployed to [Fly.io](http://fly.io).

We will primarily focus on the higher-level concepts of Dioxus without diving deep into the details of specific APIs. We recommend experimenting with the APIs yourself or reading the [Core Concepts](../essentials/index.md) and specific [Guides](../guides/index.md) for more information.

## What will we be learning?

This guide will cover the "core" Dioxus features including:

* [Tooling Setup](tooling.md)
* [Creating a new app](new_app.md)
* [How Components Work](component.md)
* [Creating UI with RSX](rsx.md)
* [Styling and Assets](assets.md)
* [Adding State](state.md)
* [Fetching Data](data_fetching.md)
* [Adding a Backend](backend.md)
* [Integrating a Database](databases.md)
* [App Routing](routing.md)
* [Bundling](bundle.md)
* [Deployment](deploy.md)
* [Next Steps](next_steps.md)

Dioxus is a very full-featured framework, so we encourage you to follow up this tutorial by building your own larger apps.

## What are we building?

The features of *HotDog* are fairly simple:

* Engage with a stream of cute dog photos
* Swipe right if we want to save the dog photo to our collection
* Swipe left if we don't want to save the dog photo
* View the dog photos we saved later

At the end of the tutorial, you'll have your very own *HotDog* app to remix and download to your device.
