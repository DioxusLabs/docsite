# Managing Fullstack Dependencies

Fullstack applications build to at least two different binaries:
- The client application that runs the desktop, mobile, or web application
- The server that renders the initial HTML and runs server functions

Those binaries tend to have different dependencies and those dependencies often are only compatible with a specific target platform. This guide will cover how fullstack manages each binary's dependencies and how to add dependencies that are only compatible with one binary/target.

## Client and Server Feature Flags

Dioxus uses feature flags to differentiate between the different binaries a single library can produce. Each target binary should have a feature flag in your `Cargo.toml` file that enables the corresponding feature in dioxus. For example, if you are targeting `web` and `desktop` with a fullstack server, you would add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
# Don't include any renderer features in your dioxus dependency directly. They will be added in feature flags.
# The fullstack feature enables the bindings between the server and client without enabling a specific binary target.
dioxus = { version = "0.6", features = ["fullstack"] }

[features]
# The web feature enables the web renderer. Dioxus will automatically enable the feature you define that activates `dioxus/web` when building the client WASM bundle.
web = ["dioxus/web"]
# The desktop feature enables the desktop renderer. Dioxus will automatically enable the feature you define that activates `dioxus/desktop` when building the client native bundle.
desktop = ["dioxus/desktop"]
# The server feature enables server functions and server-side rendering. Dioxus will automatically enable the feature you define that activates `dioxus/server` when building the server binary.
server = ["dioxus/server"]
```

Feature flags like these for the client and server are automatically generated by the CLI when you run `dx new` with fullstack enabled. If you are creating a project from scratch, you will need to add the feature flags manually.

## Adding Server Only Dependencies

Many dependencies like [`tokio`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/index.html) and [`axum`](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/index.html) are only compatible with the server. If these dependencies are enabled when building a WASM bundle for the browser client, you will get a compilation error. For example, if we want to interact with the filesystem in a server function, we might want to add `tokio`. `tokio` has utilities for working with async IO like [`tokio::fs::File`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/fs/struct.File.html). Let's try it as a dependency to our fullstack project:

```toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ❌ If tokio is added as a required dependency, it will be included in both the server
# and the web bundle. The web bundle will fail to build because tokio is not
# compatible with wasm
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

If we try to compile with tokio as a required dependency, we will get a compilation error like this:

```shell
error[E0432]: unresolved import `crate::sys::IoSourceState`
  --> /Users/user/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/mio-1.0.2/src   |source.rs:14:5
14 | use crate::sys::IoSourceState;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no `IoSourceState` in `sys`
...
```

Since we added `tokio` as a dependency for all three binaries, cargo tries to compile it for each target. This fails because `tokio` is not compatible with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

To fix the issue, we can **make the dependency optional and only enable it in the server feature**:

```toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ✅ Since the tokio dependency is optional, it is not included in the web and desktop
# bundles.
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"], optional = true }

[features]
# ...
# ✅ Since the tokio dependency is enabled in the server feature, it is included in
# the server binary.
server = ["dioxus/server", "dep:tokio"]
```

Now when we build with `dx serve`, the project compiles successfully.

## Adding Client Only Dependencies

Many dependencies like [`wasm-bindgen`](https://docs.rs/wasm-bindgen/latest/wasm_bindgen/index.html) and [`web-sys`](https://docs.rs/web-sys/latest/web_sys/index.html) are only compatible with the client. Unlike server-only dependencies, these dependencies can generally compile on native targets, but they will panic when used outside of the browser.


You can cut down on build times for your server and native binaries by only including web dependencies in the browser client binary.


Instead of adding web only dependencies every binary in your project like this:
```toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ❌ If web-sys is added as a required dependency, it will be included in the server,
# native, and the web bundle which makes build times longer.
web-sys = { version = "0.3.60", features = ["console"] }
```

You can make the dependency optional and only enable it in the `web` feature in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
# ...
# ✅ Since the web-sys dependency is optional, it is not included in the server and
# native bundles.
web-sys = { version = "0.3.60", features = ["console"], optional = true }

[features]
# ...
# ✅ Since the web-sys dependency is enabled in the web feature, it is included in
# the web bundle.
web = ["dioxus/web", "dep:web-sys"]
```

## Managing Binary Specific Imports

Once you have set up binary specific dependencies, you need to adjust any of your imports to only import the dependencies when building for the binary that includes those dependencies.


For example, if `tokio` is only enabled in the server feature, you will need to import it like this:
```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/server_tokio_import.rs:tokio_import}}
```

You also need to only compile any usage of the dependency when the feature is enabled:
```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/server_tokio_import.rs:tokio_usage}}
```

It may be more convenient to group server or client specific code into a module that is only compiled when the feature is enabled:
```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/server_tokio_import.rs:tokio_module}}
```
