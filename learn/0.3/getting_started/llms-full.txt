# Desktop Overview

Build a standalone native desktop app that looks and feels the same across operating systems.

Apps built with Dioxus are typically \<5mb in size and use existing system resources, so they won't hog extreme amounts of RAM or memory.

Examples:

* [File Explorer](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/blob/master/file-explorer)
* [WiFi Scanner](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/blob/master/wifi-scanner)

[![File ExplorerExample](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/raw/master/file-explorer/assets/image.png)](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/tree/master/file-explorer)

## Support

The desktop is a powerful target for Dioxus but is currently limited in capability when compared to the Web platform. Currently, desktop apps are rendered with the platform's WebView library, but your Rust code is running natively on a native thread. This means that browser APIs are *not* available, so rendering WebGL, Canvas, etc is not as easy as the Web. However, native system APIs *are* accessible, so streaming, WebSockets, filesystem, etc are all viable APIs. In the future, we plan to move to a custom web renderer-based DOM renderer with WGPU integrations.

Dioxus Desktop is built off [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). Right now there aren't any Dioxus abstractions over keyboard shortcuts, menubar, handling, etc, so you'll want to leverage Tauri – mostly [Wry](http://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/) and [Tao](http://github.com/tauri-apps/tao)) directly.

# Getting started

## Platform-Specific Dependencies

Dioxus desktop renders through a web view. Depending on your platform, you might need to install some dependancies.

### Windows

Windows Desktop apps depend on WebView2 – a library that should be installed in all modern Windows distributions. If you have Edge installed, then Dioxus will work fine. If you *don't* have Webview2, [then you can install it through Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/). MS provides 3 options:

1. A tiny "evergreen" *bootstrapper* that fetches an installer from Microsoft's CDN
1. A tiny *installer* that fetches Webview2 from Microsoft's CDN
1. A statically linked version of Webview2 in your final binary for offline users

For development purposes, use Option 1.

### Linux

Webview Linux apps require WebkitGtk. When distributing, this can be part of your dependency tree in your `.rpm` or `.deb`. However, likely, your users will already have WebkitGtk.

````bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libappindicator3-dev
````

When using Debian/bullseye `libappindicator3-dev` is no longer available but replaced by `libayatana-appindicator3-dev`.

````bash
# on Debian/bullseye use:
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev
````

If you run into issues, make sure you have all the basics installed, as outlined in the [Tauri docs](https://tauri.studio/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#setting-up-linux).

### MacOS

Currently – everything for macOS is built right in! However, you might run into an issue if you're using nightly Rust due to some permissions issues in our Tao dependency (which have been resolved but not published).

## Creating a Project

Create a new crate:

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd demo
````

Add Dioxus and the desktop renderer as dependencies (this will edit your `Cargo.toml`):

````shell
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-desktop
````

Edit your `main.rs`:

````rs@hello_world_desktop.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
// import the prelude to get access to the `rsx!` macro and the `Scope` and `Element` types
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // launch the dioxus app in a webview
    dioxus_desktop::launch(App);
}

// define a component that renders a div with the text "Hello, world!"
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}
````
# Web

Build single-page applications that run in the browser with Dioxus. To run on the Web, your app must be compiled to WebAssembly and depend on the `dioxus` and `dioxus-web` crates.

A build of Dioxus for the web will be roughly equivalent to the size of a React build (70kb vs 65kb) but it will load significantly faster because [WebAssembly can be compiled as it is streamed](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/).

Examples:

* [TodoMVC](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/tree/master/todomvc)
* [ECommerce](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/tree/master/ecommerce-site)

[![TodoMVC example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/raw/master/todomvc/example.png)](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/blob/master/todomvc)

 > 
 > Note: Because of the limitations of Wasm, [not every crate will work](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/reference/which-crates-work-with-wasm.html) with your web apps, so you'll need to make sure that your crates work without native system calls (timers, IO, etc).

## Support

The Web is the best-supported target platform for Dioxus.

* Because your app will be compiled to WASM you have access to browser APIs through [wasm-bingen](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/introduction.html).
* Dioxus provides hydration to resume apps that are rendered on the server. See the [hydration example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/master/packages/web/examples/hydrate.rs) for more details.

## Tooling

To develop your Dioxus app for the web, you'll need a tool to build and serve your assets. We recommend using [dioxus-cli](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/cli) which includes a build system, Wasm optimization, a dev server, and support hot reloading:

````shell
cargo install dioxus-cli
````

Make sure the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target for rust is installed:

````shell
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
````

## Creating a Project

Create a new crate:

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd demo
````

Add Dioxus and the web renderer as dependencies (this will edit your `Cargo.toml`):

````bash
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-web
````

Edit your `main.rs`:

````rs@hello_world_web.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
// import the prelude to get access to the `rsx!` macro and the `Scope` and `Element` types
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // launch the web app
    dioxus_web::launch(App);
}

// create a component that renders a div with the text "Hello, world!"
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}

````

And to serve our app:

````bash
dioxus serve
````
# Setting Up Hot Reload

1. Hot reloading allows much faster iteration times inside of rsx calls by interpreting them and streaming the edits.
1. It is useful when changing the styling/layout of a program, but will not help with changing the logic of a program.
1. Currently the cli only implements hot reloading for the web renderer.

# Setup

Install [dioxus-cli](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/cli).
Hot reloading is automatically enabled when using the web renderer on debug builds.

# Usage

1. run:

````
dioxus serve --hot-reload
````

2. change some code within a rsx macro
2. open your localhost in a browser
2. save and watch the style change without recompiling

# Limitations

1. The interpreter can only use expressions that existed on the last full recompile. If you introduce a new variable or expression to the rsx call, it will trigger a full recompile to capture the expression.
1. Components and Iterators can contain arbitrary rust code and will trigger a full recompile when changed.
# Server-Side Rendering

The Dioxus VirtualDom can be rendered server-side.

[Example: Dioxus DocSite](https://github.com/dioxusLabs/docsite)

## Multithreaded Support

The Dioxus VirtualDom, sadly, is not currently `Send`. Internally, we use quite a bit of interior mutability which is not thread-safe. This means you can't easily use Dioxus with most web frameworks like Tide, Rocket, Axum, etc.

To solve this, you'll want to spawn a VirtualDom on its own thread and communicate with it via channels.

When working with web frameworks that require `Send`, it is possible to render a VirtualDom immediately to a String – but you cannot hold the VirtualDom across an await point. For retained-state SSR (essentially LiveView), you'll need to create a pool of VirtualDoms.

## Setup

For this guide, we're going to show how to use Dioxus SSR with [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/).

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed, and then create a new project:

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd app
````

Add Dioxus and the ssr renderer as dependencies:

````shell
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-ssr
````

Next, add all the Axum dependencies. This will be different if you're using a different Web Framework

````
cargo add tokio --features full
cargo add axum
````

Your dependencies should look roughly like this:

````toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.4.5"
dioxus = { version = "*" }
dioxus-ssr = { version = "*" }
tokio = { version = "1.15.0", features = ["full"] }
````

Now, set up your Axum app to respond on an endpoint.

````rust
use axum::{response::Html, routing::get, Router};
use dioxus::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let addr = std::net::SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
    println!("listening on http://{}", addr);

    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(
            Router::new()
                .route("/", get(app_endpoint))
                .into_make_service(),
        )
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
````

And then add our endpoint. We can either render `rsx!` directly:

````rust
async fn app_endpoint() -> Html<String> {
    // render the rsx! macro to HTML
    Html(dioxus_ssr::render_lazy(rsx! {
        div { "hello world!" }
    }))
}
````

Or we can render VirtualDoms.

````rust
async fn app_endpoint() -> Html<String> {
    // create a component that renders a div with the text "hello world"
    fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
        cx.render(rsx!(div { "hello world" }))
    }
    // create a VirtualDom with the app component
    let mut app = VirtualDom::new(app);
    // rebuild the VirtualDom before rendering
    let _ = app.rebuild();

    // render the VirtualDom to HTML
    Html(dioxus_ssr::render_vdom(&app))
}
````

And that's it!

 > 
 > You might notice that you cannot hold the VirtualDom across an await point. Dioxus is currently not ThreadSafe, so it *must* remain on the thread it started. We are working on loosening this requirement.
# Liveview

Liveview allows apps to *run* on the server and *render* in the browser. It uses WebSockets to communicate between the server and the browser.

Examples:

* [`Axum Example`](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/liveview/examples/axum.rs)
* [`Salvo Example`](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/liveview/examples/salvo.rs)
* [`Warp Example`](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/liveview/examples/warp.rs)

## Support

Liveview is currently limited in capability when compared to the Web platform. Liveview apps run on the server in a native thread. This means that browser APIs are not available, so rendering WebGL, Canvas, etc is not as easy as the Web. However, native system APIs are accessible, so streaming, WebSockets, filesystem, etc are all viable APIs.

## Setup

For this guide, we're going to show how to use Dioxus Liveview with [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/).

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed, and then create a new project:

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd app
````

Add Dioxus and the liveview renderer with the Axum feature as dependencies:

````shell
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-liveview --features axum
````

Next, add all the Axum dependencies. This will be different if you're using a different Web Framework

````
cargo add tokio --features full
cargo add axum
````

Your dependencies should look roughly like this:

````toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.4.5"
dioxus = { version = "*" }
dioxus-liveview = { version = "*", features = ["axum"] }
tokio = { version = "1.15.0", features = ["full"] }
````

Now, set up your Axum app to respond on an endpoint.

````rs@hello_world_liveview.rs
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let addr: std::net::SocketAddr = ([127, 0, 0, 1], 3030).into();

    let view = dioxus_liveview::LiveViewPool::new();

    let app = Router::new()
        // The root route contains the glue code to connect to the WebSocket
        .route(
            "/",
            get(move || async move {
                Html(format!(
                    r#"
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                <head> <title>Dioxus LiveView with Axum</title>  </head>
                <body> <div id="main"></div> </body>
                {glue}
                </html>
                "#,
                    // Create the glue code to connect to the WebSocket on the "/ws" route
                    glue = dioxus_liveview::interpreter_glue(&format!("ws://{addr}/ws"))
                ))
            }),
        )
        // The WebSocket route is what Dioxus uses to communicate with the browser
        .route(
            "/ws",
            get(move |ws: WebSocketUpgrade| async move {
                ws.on_upgrade(move |socket| async move {
                    // When the WebSocket is upgraded, launch the LiveView with the app component
                    _ = view.launch(dioxus_liveview::axum_socket(socket), app).await;
                })
            }),
        );

    println!("Listening on http://{}", addr);

    axum::Server::bind(&addr.to_string().parse().unwrap())
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
````

And then add our app component:

````rs@hello_world_liveview.rs
fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}
````

And that's it!
# Terminal UI

You can build a text-based interface that will run in the terminal using Dioxus.

![Hello World screenshot](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/rink/raw/master/examples/example.png)

 > 
 > Note: this book was written with HTML-based platforms in mind. You might be able to follow along with TUI, but you'll have to adapt a bit.

## Support

TUI support is currently quite experimental. But, if you're willing to venture into the realm of the unknown, this guide will get you started.

* It uses flexbox for the layout
* It only supports a subset of the attributes and elements
* Regular widgets will not work in the tui render, but the tui renderer has its own widget components that start with a capital letter. See the [widgets example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/master/packages/tui/examples/tui_widgets.rs)
* 1px is one character line height. Your regular CSS px does not translate
* If your app panics, your terminal is wrecked. This will be fixed eventually

## Getting Set up

Start by making a new package and adding Dioxus and the TUI renderer as dependancies.

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd demo
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-tui
````

Then, edit your `main.rs` with the basic template.

````rs@hello_world_tui.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
// import the prelude to get access to the `rsx!` macro and the `Scope` and `Element` types
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // launch the app in the terminal
    dioxus_tui::launch(App);
}

// create a component that renders a div with the text "Hello, world!"
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}

````

To run our app:

````shell
cargo run
````

Press "ctrl-c" to close the app. To switch from "ctrl-c" to just "q" to quit you can launch the app with a configuration to disable the default quit and use the root TuiContext to quit on your own.

````rs@hello_world_tui_no_ctrl_c.rs
// todo remove deprecated
#![allow(non_snake_case, deprecated)]

use dioxus::events::{KeyCode, KeyboardEvent};
use dioxus::prelude::*;
use dioxus_tui::TuiContext;

fn main() {
    dioxus_tui::launch_cfg(
        App,
        dioxus_tui::Config::new()
            .without_ctrl_c_quit()
            // Some older terminals only support 16 colors or ANSI colors
            // If your terminal is one of these, change this to BaseColors or ANSI
            .with_rendering_mode(dioxus_tui::RenderingMode::Rgb),
    );
}

fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let tui_ctx: TuiContext = cx.consume_context().unwrap();

    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            width: "100%",
            height: "10px",
            background_color: "red",
            justify_content: "center",
            align_items: "center",
            onkeydown: move |k: KeyboardEvent| if let KeyCode::Q = k.key_code {
                tui_ctx.quit();
            },

            "Hello world!"
        }
    })
}

# Mobile App

Build a mobile app with Dioxus!

Example: [Todo App](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/blob/master/ios_demo)

## Support

Mobile is currently the least-supported renderer target for Dioxus. Mobile apps are rendered with either the platform's WebView or experimentally through [WGPU](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz). WebView doesn't support animations, transparency, and native widgets.

Mobile support is currently best suited for CRUD-style apps, ideally for internal teams who need to develop quickly but don't care much about animations or native widgets.

This guide is primarily targeted at iOS apps, however, you can follow it while using the `android` guide in `cargo-mobile`.

## Getting Set up

Getting set up with mobile can be quite challenging. The tooling here isn't great (yet) and might take some hacking around to get things working. macOS M1 is broadly unexplored and might not work for you.

We're going to be using `cargo-mobile` to build for mobile. First, install it:

````shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/BrainiumLLC/cargo-mobile
````

And then initialize your app for the right platform. Use the `winit` template for now. Right now, there's no "Dioxus" template in cargo-mobile.

````shell
cargo mobile init
````

We're going to completely clear out the `dependencies` it generates for us, swapping out `winit` with `dioxus-mobile`.

````toml

[package]
name = "dioxus-ios-demo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = []
edition = "2018"


# leave the `lib` declaration
[lib]
crate-type = ["staticlib", "cdylib", "rlib"]


# leave the binary it generates for us
[[bin]]
name = "dioxus-ios-demo-desktop"
path = "gen/bin/desktop.rs"

# clear all the dependencies
[dependencies]
mobile-entry-point = "0.1.0"
dioxus = { version = "*"}
dioxus-desktop = { version = "*" }
simple_logger = "*"
````

Edit your `lib.rs`:

````rust
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    dioxus_desktop::launch(app);
}

fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx!{
        div {
            "hello world!"
        }
    })
}
````
