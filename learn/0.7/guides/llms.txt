# Dioxus Guides

These guides build on topics covered in the [core concepts](../essentials/index.md) chapter to provide more detailed explanations and examples. While we recommend everyone read either the entire [tutorial](../tutorial/index.md) or [core concepts](../essentials/index.md) chapters as you learn dioxus, these guides are intended for users who want to dive deeper into specific topics as needed.

## Tools

Dioxus provides a set of tools to make building cross platform applications easier. The [`dioxus-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/dioxus-cli) is the core tool for building, running, and managing dioxus applications. The [`tools`](./tools/index.md) guide provides more information on the various tools available in the dioxus ecosystem.

## Platforms

When you build an app with dioxus, most of your application code can be platform agnostic. When you do need to interact with platform specific features, dioxus provides a variety of platform backends to help you do so. The [platforms](./platforms/index.md) guide provides more information on the various platforms supported by dioxus.

## Publishing

Once you finish building your application, the [publishing guide](./deploy/index.md) provides an overview of how to package and distribute your application. It also includes information about what configuration options are available for bundling.

## Custom Renderer

If you are ready to dive into building your own renderer for dioxus, the [custom renderer guide](./depth/custom_renderer.md) provides an overview of how to get started.

## Migration

If you are updating from an older version of dioxus, the [migration guides](../migration/index.md) provide information about breaking changes and how to update your code to work with the latest version of dioxus.
