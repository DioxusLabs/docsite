# Your First Component

This chapter will teach you how to create a [Component](../reference/components.md) that displays a link to a post on hackernews.

First, let's define how to display a post. Dioxus is a *declarative* framework. This means that instead of telling Dioxus what to do (e.g. to "create an element" or "set the color to red") we simply *declare* how we want the UI to look.

To declare what you want your UI to look like, you will need to use the `rsx` macro. Let's modify the rsx macro in the `App` function from the [getting started](../getting_started/index.md) to show information about our story:

```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/hackernews_post.rs:story_v1}}
```

If you run your application you should see something like this:

```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
	hackernews_post::story_v1::App {}
}
```

> RSX mirrors HTML. Because of this you will need to know some html to use Dioxus.

> Here are some resources to help get you started learning HTML:
> - [MDN HTML Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)
> - [W3 Schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
> 
> In addition to HTML, Dioxus uses CSS to style applications. You can either use traditional CSS (what this guide uses) or use a tool like [tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation):
> - [MDN Traditional CSS Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)
> - [W3 Schools Traditional CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
> - [Tailwind tutorial](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) (used with the [Tailwind setup example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/examples/tailwind))
> 
> If you have existing html code, you can use the [translate](../CLI/translate.md) command to convert it to RSX. Or if you prefer to write html, you can use the [html! macro](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus-html-macro) to write html directly in your code.

## Dynamic Text

Let's expand our `App` component to include the story title, author, score, time posted, and number of comments. We can insert dynamic text in the render macro by inserting variables inside `{}`s (this works similarly to the formatting in the [println!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html) macro):

```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/hackernews_post.rs:story_v2}}
```

```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
	hackernews_post::story_v2::App {}
}
```

## Creating Elements

Next, let's wrap our post description in a [`div`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div). You can create HTML elements in Dioxus by putting a `{` after the element name and a `}` after the last child of the element:

```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/hackernews_post.rs:story_v3}}
```

```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
	hackernews_post::story_v3::App {}
}
```

> You can read more about elements in the [rsx reference](../reference/rsx.md).

## Setting Attributes

Next, let's add some padding around our post listing with an attribute.

Attributes (and [listeners](../reference/event_handlers.md)) modify the behavior or appearance of the element they are attached to. They are specified inside the `{}` brackets before any children, using the `name: value` syntax. You can format the text in the attribute as you would with a text node:

```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/hackernews_post.rs:story_v4}}
```

```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
	hackernews_post::story_v4::App {}
}
```

> Note: All attributes defined in [`dioxus-html`](https://docs.rs/dioxus-html/latest/dioxus_html/) follow the snake_case naming convention. They transform their `snake_case` names to HTML's `camelCase` attributes.

> Note: Styles can be used directly outside of the `style:` attribute. In the above example, `padding: "0.5rem"` is turned into `style="padding: 0.5rem"`.

> You can read more about elements in the [attribute reference](../reference/rsx.md)

## Creating a Component

Just like you wouldn't want to write a complex program in a single, long, `main` function, you shouldn't build a complex UI in a single `App` function. Instead, you should break down the functionality of an app in logical parts called components.

A component is a Rust function, named in UpperCamelCase, that takes a props parameter and returns an `Element` describing the UI it wants to render. In fact, our `App` function is a component!

Let's pull our story description into a new component:

```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/hackernews_post.rs:story_v5}}
```

We can render our component like we would an element by putting `{}`s after the component name. Let's modify our `App` component to render our new StoryListing component:

```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/hackernews_post.rs:app_v5}}
```

```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
	hackernews_post::story_v5::App {}
}
```

> You can read more about elements in the [component reference](../reference/components.md)

## Creating Props

Just like you can pass arguments to a function or attributes to an element, you can pass props to a component that customize its behavior!

We can define arguments that components can take when they are rendered (called `Props`) by adding the `#[component]` macro before our function definition and adding extra function arguments.

Currently, our `StoryListing` component always renders the same story. We can modify it to accept a story to render as a prop.


We will also define what a post is and include information for how to transform our post to and from a different format using [serde](https://serde.rs). This will be used with the hackernews API in a later chapter:

```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/hackernews_post.rs:story_v6}}
```

Now, let's modify the `App` component to pass the story to our `StoryListing` component like we would set an attribute on an element:

```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/hackernews_post.rs:app_v6}}
```

```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
	hackernews_post::story_v6::App {}
}
```

> You can read more about Props in the [Props reference](../reference/component_props.md)

## Cleaning Up Our Interface

Finally, by combining elements and attributes, we can make our post listing much more appealing:

Full code up to this point:

```rust
{{#include src/doc_examples/hackernews_post.rs:story_final}}
```

```inject-dioxus
DemoFrame {
	hackernews_post::story_final::App {}
}
```
