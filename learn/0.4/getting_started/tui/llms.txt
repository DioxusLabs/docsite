# Terminal UI

You can build a text-based interface that will run in the terminal using Dioxus.

 > 
 > Note: this book was written with HTML-based platforms in mind. You might be able to follow along with TUI, but you'll have to adapt a bit.

## Support

TUI support is currently quite experimental. But, if you're willing to venture into the realm of the unknown, this guide will get you started.

* It uses flexbox for the layout
* It only supports a subset of the attributes and elements
* Regular widgets will not work in the tui render, but the tui renderer has its own widget components that start with a capital letter. See the [widgets example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/master/packages/dioxus-tui/examples/widgets.rs)
* 1px is one character line height. Your regular CSS px does not translate
* If your app panics, your terminal is wrecked. This will be fixed eventually

## Getting Set up

Start by making a new package and adding Dioxus and the TUI renderer as dependencies.

````shell
cargo new --bin demo
cd demo
cargo add dioxus
cargo add dioxus-tui
````

Then, edit your `main.rs` with the basic template.

````rs@hello_world_tui.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
// import the prelude to get access to the `rsx!` macro and the `Scope` and `Element` types
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // launch the app in the terminal
    dioxus_tui::launch(App);
}

// create a component that renders a div with the text "Hello, world!"
fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            "Hello, world!"
        }
    })
}

````

To run our app:

````shell
cargo run
````

Press "ctrl-c" to close the app. To switch from "ctrl-c" to just "q" to quit you can launch the app with a configuration to disable the default quit and use the root TuiContext to quit on your own.

````rs@hello_world_tui_no_ctrl_c.rs
// todo remove deprecated
#![allow(non_snake_case, deprecated)]

use dioxus::events::{KeyCode, KeyboardEvent};
use dioxus::prelude::*;
use dioxus_tui::TuiContext;

fn main() {
    dioxus_tui::launch_cfg(
        App,
        dioxus_tui::Config::new()
            .without_ctrl_c_quit()
            // Some older terminals only support 16 colors or ANSI colors
            // If your terminal is one of these, change this to BaseColors or ANSI
            .with_rendering_mode(dioxus_tui::RenderingMode::Rgb),
    );
}

fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let tui_ctx: TuiContext = cx.consume_context().unwrap();

    cx.render(rsx! {
        div {
            width: "100%",
            height: "10px",
            background_color: "red",
            justify_content: "center",
            align_items: "center",
            onkeydown: move |k: KeyboardEvent| if let KeyCode::Q = k.key_code {
                tui_ctx.quit();
            },

            "Hello world!"
        }
    })
}

## Hot Reload

1. Hot reloading allows much faster iteration times inside of rsx calls by interpreting them and streaming the edits.
1. It is useful when changing the styling/layout of a program, but will not help with changing the logic of a program.

### Setup

Install [dioxus-cli](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/cli).

### Usage

1. Run:

````bash
dx serve --hot-reload --platform desktop
````

2. Change some code within a rsx or render macro
2. Save and watch the style change without recompiling

### Limitations

1. The interpreter can only use expressions that existed on the last full recompile. If you introduce a new variable or expression to the rsx call, it will require a full recompile to capture the expression.
1. Components, Iterators, and some attributes can contain arbitrary rust code and will trigger a full recompile when changed.
