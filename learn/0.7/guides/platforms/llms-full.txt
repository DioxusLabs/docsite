# Web

To run on the Web, your app must be compiled to WebAssembly and depend on the `dioxus` and `dioxus-web` crates.

A build of Dioxus for the web will be roughly equivalent to the size of a React build (70kb vs 65kb) but it will load significantly faster because [WebAssembly can be compiled as it is streamed](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/).

Examples:

* [TodoMVC](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/main/examples/todomvc.rs)
* [Tailwind App](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/main/examples/tailwind)

[![TodoMVC example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/raw/master/todomvc/example.png)](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/main/examples/todomvc.rs)

 > 
 > Note: Because of the limitations of Wasm, [not every crate will work](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/reference/which-crates-work-with-wasm.html) with your web apps, so you'll need to make sure that your crates work without native system calls (timers, IO, etc).

## Support

The Web is the best-supported target platform for Dioxus.

* Because your app will be compiled to WASM you have access to browser APIs through [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/introduction.html).
* Dioxus provides hydration to resume apps that are rendered on the server. See the [fullstack](../../essentials/fullstack/index.md) reference for more information.

## Running Javascript

Dioxus provides some ergonomic wrappers over the browser API, but in some cases you may need to access parts of the browser API Dioxus does not expose.

For these cases, Dioxus web exposes the use_eval hook that allows you to run raw Javascript in the webview:

````rs@eval.rs
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    launch(app);
}

fn app() -> Element {
    let future = use_resource(move || async move {
        // You can create as many eval instances as you want
        let mut eval = document::eval(
            r#"
            // You can send messages from JavaScript to Rust with the dioxus.send function
            dioxus.send("Hi from JS!");
            // You can receive messages from Rust to JavaScript with the dioxus.recv function
            let msg = await dioxus.recv();
            console.log(msg);
            "#,
        );

        // You can send messages to JavaScript with the send method
        eval.send("Hi from Rust!").unwrap();

        // You can receive any message from JavaScript with the recv method
        eval.recv::<String>().await.unwrap()
    });

    match future.read_unchecked().as_ref() {
        Some(v) => rsx! {
            p { "{v}" }
        },
        _ => rsx! {
            p { "hello" }
        },
    }
}

````

If you are targeting web, but don't plan on targeting any other Dioxus renderer you can also use the generated wrappers in the [web-sys](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/web-sys/index.html) and [gloo](https://gloo-rs.web.app/) crates.

## Customizing Index Template

Dioxus supports providing custom index.html templates. The index.html must include a `div` with the id `main` to be used. Hot Reload is still supported. An example
is provided in the [PWA-Example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/main/examples/10-integrations/pwa/index.html).
# Desktop

This guide will cover concepts specific to the Dioxus desktop renderer.

Apps built with Dioxus desktop use the system WebView to render the page. This makes the final size of application much smaller than other WebView renderers (typically under 5MB).

Although desktop apps are rendered in a WebView, your Rust code runs natively. This means that browser APIs are *not* available, so rendering WebGL, Canvas, etc is not as easy as the Web. However, native system APIs *are* accessible, so streaming, WebSockets, the filesystem, etc are all easily accessible though system APIs.

Dioxus desktop is built on top of [wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a Rust library for creating desktop applications with a WebView.

 > 
 > In the future, we plan to move to a custom web renderer-based DOM renderer with WGPU integrations ([Blitz](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz)).

## Examples

* [File Explorer](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/main/examples/01-app-demos/file-explorer)
* [Tailwind App](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/main/examples/tailwind)

## Running Javascript

Dioxus provides some ergonomic wrappers over the browser API, but in some cases you may need to access parts of the browser API Dioxus does not expose.

For these cases, Dioxus desktop exposes the use_eval hook that allows you to run raw Javascript in the webview:

````rs@eval.rs
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    launch(app);
}

fn app() -> Element {
    let future = use_resource(move || async move {
        // You can create as many eval instances as you want
        let mut eval = document::eval(
            r#"
            // You can send messages from JavaScript to Rust with the dioxus.send function
            dioxus.send("Hi from JS!");
            // You can receive messages from Rust to JavaScript with the dioxus.recv function
            let msg = await dioxus.recv();
            console.log(msg);
            "#,
        );

        // You can send messages to JavaScript with the send method
        eval.send("Hi from Rust!").unwrap();

        // You can receive any message from JavaScript with the recv method
        eval.recv::<String>().await.unwrap()
    });

    match future.read_unchecked().as_ref() {
        Some(v) => rsx! {
            p { "{v}" }
        },
        _ => rsx! {
            p { "hello" }
        },
    }
}

````

## Custom Assets

You can link to local assets in dioxus desktop instead of using a url:

````rs@custom_assets.rs
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    launch(app);
}

fn app() -> Element {
    rsx! {
        div {
            img { src: asset!("/assets/static/scanner.png") }
        }
    }
}

````

## Integrating with Wry

In cases where you need more low level control over your window, you can use wry APIs exposed through the [Desktop Config](https://docs.rs/dioxus-desktop/latest/dioxus_desktop/struct.Config.html) and the [use_window hook](https://docs.rs/dioxus-desktop/latest/dioxus_desktop/fn.use_window.html)
# Mobile App

Build a mobile app with Dioxus!

## Support

The Rust ecosystem for mobile continues to mature, with Dioxus offering strong support for mobile applications. Mobile is a first-class target for Dioxus apps, with a robust WebView implementation that supports CSS animations and transparency effects.

Mobile apps are rendered with either the platform's WebView or experimentally with WGPU. While native Android animations and widgets aren't currently supported, CSS-based animations and styling provide a powerful alternative.

Mobile support is well-suited for most application types, from business tools to consumer apps, making it an excellent choice for teams looking to build cross-platform applications with a single codebase.

## Getting Set up

## Android

Android devices run a different executable architecture than desktop and web. We need to install these toolchains to build Dioxus apps for Android.

First, install the Rust Android targets:

````sh
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
````

To develop on Android, you will need to [install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Once you have installed Android Studio, you will need to install the Android SDK and NDK:

1. Create a blank Android project
1. Select `Tools > SDK manager`
1. Navigate to the `SDK tools` window:

![NDK install window](/assets/static/android_ndk_install.png)

Then select:

* The SDK
* The SDK Command line tools
* The NDK (side by side)
* CMAKE

4. Select `apply` and follow the prompts

 > 
 > More details that could be useful for debugging any errors you encounter are available [in the official android docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update#sdk-manager)

Next set the Java, Android, NDK, and PATH variables:

Mac:

````sh
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
export NDK_HOME="$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/25.2.9519653"
export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"
````

Windows:

````powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("JAVA_HOME", "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr", "User")
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANDROID_HOME", "$env:LocalAppData\Android\Sdk", "User")
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("NDK_HOME", "$env:LocalAppData\Android\Sdk\ndk\25.2.9519653", "User")
````

 > 
 > The NDK version in the paths should match the version you installed in the last step

We manually set the PATH variable to include the Android emulator since some distributions of Android Studio include the emulator in the wrong location.

## IOS

To develop on IOS, you will need to [install XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835). Also make sure to install the iOS targets

````sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim
````

 > 
 > If you are using M1, you will have to run `cargo build --target x86_64-apple-ios` instead of `cargo apple build` if you want to run in simulator.

You will also need to install the iOS SDK and the Xcode command line tools.

## Running your app

Starting with Dioxus 0.6, `dx` ships with built-in support for mobile.

Simply create a new Dioxus project:

````sh
dx new my-app
````

Make sure to launch the relevant mobile simulator. For Android, you can use the Android Studio emulator, or the Android Emulator in the terminal. Make sure to adjust the device name depending on which emulator you installed.

````sh
emulator -avd Pixel_6_API_34  -netdelay none -netspeed full
````

For iOS, you can use the iOS simulator. You can launch it with:

````sh
open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15 Pro Max"
````

And then run the app with:

````sh
cd my-app
dx serve
````

This will start the app in development mode.
