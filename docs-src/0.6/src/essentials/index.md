The essentials section will guide you through key concepts in Dioxus:

- [Building UIs with RSX](rsx/index.md) will teach you how to define html inside your Dioxus app with rsx.

- [Component Lifecycle](lifecycle/index.md) teaches you about the lifecycle of components along with the hooks you need to run code when the component is first created, mounted, and removed.

- [Managing State](state/index.md) guides you through how state works in Dioxus. It will teach you how to create state with `use_signal`, derive state with `use_memo`, and integrate state with asynchronous tasks with `use_resource`. Along the way, you will learn about you can use reactivity to declaratively describe your UI.

- [Breaking Out](breaking/index.md) will teach you how to break out of Dioxus' rendering model to run JavaScript or interact with the DOM directly with `web-sys`.
