# Roadmap

This feature set and roadmap can help you decide if what Dioxus can do today works for you.

If a feature that you need doesn't exist or you want to contribute to projects on the roadmap, feel free to get involved by [joining the discord](https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM).

Generally, here's the status of each platform:

- **Web**: Dioxus is a great choice for pure web-apps – especially for CRUD/complex apps. However, it does lack the ecosystem of React, so you might be missing a component library or some useful hook.

- **SSR**: Dioxus is a great choice for pre-rendering, hydration, and rendering HTML on a web endpoint. Be warned – the VirtualDom is not (currently) `Send + Sync`.

- **Desktop**: You can build very competent single-window desktop apps right now. However, multi-window apps require support from Dioxus core and are not ready.

- **Mobile**: Mobile support is very young. You'll be figuring things out as you go and there are not many support crates for peripherals.

- **LiveView**: LiveView support is very young. You'll be figuring things out as you go. Thankfully, none of it is too hard and any work can be upstreamed into Dioxus.

## Work in Progress

### Build Tool

We are currently working on our own build tool called [Dioxus CLI](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/main/packages/cli) which will support:

- an interactive TUI
- on-the-fly reconfiguration
- hot CSS reloading
- two-way data binding between browser and source code
- an interpreter for `rsx!`
- ability to publish to github/netlify/vercel
- bundling for iOS/Desktop/etc

### Server Component Support

While not currently fully implemented, the expectation is that LiveView apps can be a hybrid between Wasm and server-rendered where only portions of a page are "live" and the rest of the page is either server-rendered, statically generated, or handled by the host SPA.

### Native rendering

We are currently working on a native renderer for Dioxus using WGPU called [Blitz](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz/). This will allow you to build apps that are rendered natively for iOS, Android, and Desktop.
